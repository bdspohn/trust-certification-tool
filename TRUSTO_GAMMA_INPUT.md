## Slide 2: The $84T Problem Every Wealthy Person Knows

### Customer Pain Story
**Visual:** Split screen showing frustrated customer and banker

**Left Side - Trust Owner:**
"I needed to refinance my $2M home. Bank required trust certification. My attorney charged $1,800 and it took 26 days. The bank rejected it twice for formatting issues. I almost lost the rate lock."

**Right Side - Bank VP:**  
"We lose 40% of wealthy prospects because trust verification takes too long. They go to competitors who streamline the process. It's costing us $50M+ annually in lost deposits."

### The Hidden Friction Costs

- **$800-$2,000** average cost per verification (Estate Planning Council, 2024)
