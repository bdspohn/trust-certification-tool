## Demo Script (8-10 minutes)

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"How many of you have a trust? [Show of hands] How many have had to deal with bank trust certifications? [Fewer hands] For those who haven't - you're lucky. For those who have - you know exactly why we built this."*

*"Let me show you how Trusto transforms what used to be a 3-week, $2,000 nightmare into a 5-minute, $50 solution."*

### Current State Problem Demo (2 minutes)

**Show Competitor/Manual Process:**
*"This is what trust owners face today:"*

1. **Show bank trust certification form** (PDF)
   - *"Here's Wells Fargo's trust certification form. 4 pages, 47 blank fields, legal jargon everywhere."*
   
2. **Show another bank's form**
   - *"And here's Chase's version. Completely different format, different requirements. Every bank has their own form."*

3. **Show typical errors**
   - *"Trust owners fill these out manually, make errors, forms get rejected, process starts over. Average: 2-3 iterations, 3 weeks total."*

### Trusto Solution Demo (4 minutes)

**Live Demo at Trusto.inc:**

**Step 1: Upload (30 seconds)**
*"Now watch this. I'm going to upload a trust document."*
- Navigate to Trusto.inc
- Click "Get Started" or upload area
- Drag and drop sample trust document
- *"Notice: We support PDF, Word docs, even text files. Enterprise-grade security, SOC2 compliant."*

**Step 2: AI Processing (1 minute)**
*"Our AI is now reading this 47-page trust document..."*
- Show processing animation
- *"In 30 seconds, it's extracted all the key information that would take a lawyer 2 hours to review."*
- Point out the progress indicators

**Step 3: Extraction Results (1.5 minutes)**
*"Look at these results:"*
- **Trust Name:** *"95% confident - perfectly extracted"*
- **Trustees:** *"88% confident - got both John and Jane Doe"*  
- **Powers:** *"82% confident - flagged for review, which is exactly what we want"*
- **Date, State, etc.:** Point out each field

*"This confidence scoring is crucial. We're not just extracting data - we're telling you which fields to double-check. This prevents the errors that cause rejections."*

**Step 4: Form Generation (1 minute)**
*"Now I select the bank - let's say Wells Fargo:"*
- Show bank selection dropdown
- Click Wells Fargo
- *"Boom. Auto-populated their exact form, properly formatted."*
- Compare side-by-side with original blank form
- *"Same form that took 3 weeks to complete manually, done in 3 minutes."*

- **Bank-specific forms:** *"Every institution's exact requirements"*
- **Security first:** *"Built for financial institution standards from day one"*

### Future Vision (30 seconds)

## Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions & Responses:

**Q: "What about liability? What if your AI makes an error?"**
A: *"Great question. Three-layer protection: 1) Confidence scoring flags uncertain extractions, 2) Professional liability insurance covers errors, 3) Legal review available through our ABS partnership. Plus, we're still more accurate than manual entry."*

**Q: "How do you get banks to adopt this?"**
A: *"Banks want this more than consumers do. JPMorgan spends $50-100M annually on trust processing. We save them 80% of that cost while improving customer satisfaction. It's an easy ROI calculation."*

**Q: "What about regulatory compliance?"**
A: *"We've researched all 50 states. Starting in Arizona's regulatory sandbox gives us first-mover advantage. Neil's ABS firm handles legal complexity. This is a feature, not a bug - regulatory complexity is our moat."*

**Q: "Why hasn't someone built this before?"**
A: *"Perfect storm of factors: 1) AI finally reliable enough, 2) Banks finally embracing APIs, 3) E-signature adoption post-COVID, 4) ABS structures now available. Plus, trust law complexity scared off most players."*

**Q: "What's your competitive advantage if big tech enters?"**
A: *"Network effects, regulatory expertise, and trust relationships. This isn't just a tech problem - it's legal + tech + banking relationships. Takes years to build properly."*

**Q: "How do you scale the legal services side?"**
A: *"Technology-enabled delivery. AI handles 80% of work, attorneys review edge cases. Neil's ABS structure lets us operate in multiple states through one firm. Not traditional law firm economics."*

1. **Screen recording backup:** Pre-recorded full demo
2. **Screenshot walkthrough:** Static images with narration
3. **Competitor comparison:** Show manual process pain points
4. **Customer testimonials:** Use case studies instead

### Technical Issues:
