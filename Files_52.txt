Letter to Client 
Table of Contents
Dear [name of trustee]:I am writing regarding the [name of disabled beneficiary]'s Special Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year] (the "Trust"), which we [have prepared / reviewed upon your request].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust; and (2) discuss what you, as trustee of the Trust, need to address during administration of the Trust. Please keep this letter for future reference.To accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the trustee must adhere to the terms in the trust document and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or the person who prepares the tax returns for the Trust.The Trust describes the powers and duties of the trustee(s). Since not all trust documents (also called trust instruments) contain the same powers, closely review and familiarize yourself with the Trust terms to be certain of your authority, requirements imposed upon you, and options for taking action on behalf of the Trust. Reach out to me with questions about the Trust terms as you review them.The Trust is a First-Party Special Needs Trust, designed to hold assets while preserving [name of disabled beneficiary]'s ability to receive government benefits. The principal government benefit in Illinois to which [name of disabled beneficiary] is entitled is called Medical Assistance. Transfers to the Trust can consist of cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or personal property, etc., but it is important to note that no additions to the trust can be made on or after the 65th birthday of [name of disabled beneficiary]. Also, once assets are transferred to the Trust, [name of disabled beneficiary] has no control of, right to demand, or ability to withdraw any assets from the Trust.1. Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust and cannot be amended, except under limited circumstances to conform with federal or state law. Please contact me if you believe this may be an issue at any time during the administration of the trust.2. Federal Tax Identification Number. Obtain a taxpayer identification number (TIN) for the Trust from the Internal Revenue Service by filing IRS Form SS-4. The TIN serves to keep the trust assets separate from those of the settlor and identifies the trust in bank accounts and tax returns. Do not use your own social security number or the disabled beneficiary's social security number. The Trust must have its own TIN.3. Trust Funding. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the trust to be in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[Name of trustee], Trustee of The [Name of disabled beneficiary] Special Needs Trust dated [month] [day] [year]." (Some banks may want to use a slightly different name.)To transfer funds from checking, savings, and brokerage accounts, the TIN should be provided. A bank or brokerage firm may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers will serve to demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. A certification of trust prepared in accordance with Illinois law may also sometimes be used in lieu of the entire trust agreement.To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust. We can prepare the deed for the property for signature by [name of disabled beneficiary / name of guardian]. Upon obtaining the necessary signatures, we will record the deed at the county Recorder of Deeds office. You should contact the homeowner's insurance company to notify them of the title change. 4. Taxation of Trust Income. File the IRS Form 1041 and  Form IL -1041 to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year after receipt of the taxable income. We strongly recommend retaining an accountant for preparation of tax returns.5. Distributions from the Trust. The Trust was created to provide [name of disabled beneficiary] with supplemental means of support in addition to, not as replacement of, [name of disabled beneficiary]'s government benefits. Accordingly, the types of distributions that can be made to support the disabled beneficiary are limited. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support, which includes (1) housing (e.g., mortgage, real property taxes, rent, etc.); (2) utilities (e.g., gas, electricity, water, sewer, waste service, etc.) (3) food; (4) clothing; and (5) medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds are available. The government benefits are meant to cover these expenses and any payment of them using the Trust's funds could result in the loss of benefits. All distributions from the Trust are at the discretion of the trustee. Here are some examples of items for which distributions are permissible:(a) phone, cable, and internet service(b) entertainment (e.g., concerts, museums, theater, movies, tickets to sports events, subscriptions)(c) furniture(d) computer hardware and software (e) education expenses unrelated to room and board (i.e., tuition, books, computers, supplies)(f) medical equipment not covered by any other benefit(g) travel(h) nonfood grocery items (e.g., cleaning supplies, personal hygiene products, tissues) (i) eyeglasses –and– (j) automobile expensesCash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary, even if they are reimbursements or prepayments for acceptable expenditures. Instead, payments should be made directly to third parties. Distributions also should not be made to or for the benefit of anyone other than the beneficiary.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.6. Recordkeeping. Please keep detailed records of the trust assets, income, and expenditures (including the date, amount, payee, and purpose). You may be required to provide a detailed accounting of the Trust to the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (IDHFS) upon the termination of the Trust.7. Yearly Statement of Claims. Under Illinois law, the Trust is required to contain a  provision that provides for reimbursement to the IDHFS, upon the death of the disabled  beneficiary, of an amount equal to the total amount of Medical Assistance paid on  behalf of the trust beneficiary. You, as trustee, will receive an annual statement of claims  (SOC) to show the current amount owed to the IDHFS. The SOC will contain a running total  of all medical bills paid on behalf of [name of disabled beneficiary] since the execution of  the Trust.8. Reimbursement to the DHS. If the trust is terminated or [name of disabled beneficiary] dies, you, as trustee, must notify the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.  At that time, the SNT Depository will provide a final comprehensive SOC to you, showing the total reimbursement owed to the DHS. If the IDHFS will not be fully reimbursed from the Trust, a final accounting of the SNT funds should accompany the payment.9. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if either of the following events occur:• There are no more assets in the trust.• The disabled beneficiary dies and the assets of the trust, after any required reimbursement to the IDHFS for the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of [name of disabled beneficiary], are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.10. Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please make sure you understand them. I am happy to answer any questions you may have about them.I hope that this letter has answered your immediate questions. If you would like further explanation of any aspect of funding or administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.

This reimbursement must equal the total amount of Medicaid benefits paid on behalf of the trust beneficiary. As trustee, you will receive an annual Statement of Claims (SOC) from the ODM, which will detail the current amount owed. The SOC will include a running total of all medical expenses covered by Medicaid for [name of disabled beneficiary] since the execution of the Trust.(e) Reimbursement to the ODM. If the trust is terminated or [name of disabled beneficiary] passes away, you, as trustee, must notify the ODM as soon as possible. You can send the notification to ODM, Bureau of Third Party Liability, 50 W. Town Street, Suite 400, Columbus, OH 43215. The ODM will then provide a final comprehensive Statement of Claims (SOC) to you, detailing the total reimbursement amount owed to the ODM. If the ODM will not be fully reimbursed from the trust, a final accounting of the trust funds should be included with the payment.5. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:(a) There are no more assets in the trust.(b) The disabled beneficiary dies. Upon the beneficiary's death, any remaining trust assets shall first be used to reimburse the Ohio Department of Medicaid (or any other state agency providing medical assistance) for the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary under the Medicaid program. After the satisfaction of any such claims, the remaining assets shall be distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or other contingent beneficiaries as specified in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.6. Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please make sure you understand them.

Letter to Client 
[Month Day, Year][name of client 1] [OPTIONAL: and [name of client 2]][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [first name of client 1] [OPTIONAL: and [first name of client 2]]:FUNDING YOUR REVOCABLE TRUSTNow that you, as Settlor(s), have established your Revocable Trust, it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Revocable Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Revocable Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the trust during your lifetimes include IRAs and some types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trusts, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually or jointly to the Revocable Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [month] [day], [year]One of the major goals accomplished by a Revocable Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the trust assets at the time of your deaths. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets be owned by the serving Trustee of the Revocable Trust and not by you individually and/or jointly, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as outlined above.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. Generally speaking, unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, I do not recommend that your personal checking or small savings accounts, or tangible personal property (jewelry, automobiles, etc.) be transferred to the Trust. Please feel free to call me to discuss whether my general recommendation applies to your particular situation.On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution. The name on the account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trustee, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Brokerage Accounts. If you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's name and records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account and you do not own it individually. This also applies if the certificates for those assets are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name.Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund Shares. If certificates are issued in your name, both individual or jointly, new certificates must be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, in order to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the Trustee during your lifetimes.Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof). These securities must also be registered in the name of the Trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed above, if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed.Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or Debentures. These securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the Trustee, so that there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be accomplished by executing and delivering to the Trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust, listing the bearer securities being transferred, which will be retained by the Trustee with the permanent records of the trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. It would be helpful to keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the Trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects). Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Revocable Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described for unregistered securities. Any new investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the Trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the Trustee's ownership.Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership). In order to register these partnership interests in the Trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted.Interests in Real Property (Personal Residence, Investment Real Estate, and Mineral and Royalty Interests). Legal title must be transferred to the Trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a Special Warranty Deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Beneficiary-Designated Assets, such as Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan Benefits. The death benefits of these assets can be made payable to the trustee, if desired, for distribution under the terms of the Trust. However, please consult with me before taking this step, because these transfers may involve unexpected complications. Life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, just as revocable trusts do. Thus, in most cases life insurance policies are not transferred to revocable trusts. However, if there is a need to grant the trustee of your Revocable Trust control over the policy distributions, or if you fear you may become disabled and unable to administer your life insurance policy, you may wish to transfer ownership of the policy to the trustee of your Revocable Trust. IRAs and 401Ks should never be transferred to a Revocable Trust during the Settlor's lifetime. You may, however, wish to consult with me about the feasibility of establishing a trust to hold retirement assets inherited by your beneficiaries. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if transferred to a revocable trust. I would be happy to review your annuity contract and, if necessary, consult with the insurance company or plan trustee to determine whether your annuity is transferrable. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan Trustee to name the Trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if put into the Revocable Trust, so caution is advised.Safe Deposit Box. Many institutions allow a Revocable Trust to maintain a safe deposit box. This is useful in avoiding the need to obtain a court order or institute a probate proceeding simply to open the safe deposit box where no alternate individual is named with access to the box.Leases and Promissory Notes. Where a rental property is being transferred into the Revocable Trust, you should inform your tenants that the trust is now the nominal owner of the property and that future lease payments should be made to the trust. It also may be beneficial to inform tenants that the terms of their existing lease will not change, but any renewal or new lease should reflect that the landlord is the Revocable Trust. There is no need to show the tenants any portion of the Trust Agreement. Similarly, promissory notes may be assigned to the Revocable Trust, in which case the payor should be informed that the trust holds the note, that the terms of the note have not changed, and that the next payment should be made to the Revocable Trust as payee. Any liens securing notes transferred to the Revocable Trust should also be assigned to the trust and filed in the appropriate county or municipality. As with the lease, there is no need to show the payor any portion of the Trust Agreement.Firearms. While it is not illegal for your Revocable Trust to own firearms, it is ill-advised to transfer into or hold firearms in the trust. In addition to it imposing significant risk and liability to the Trustee, most firearms are highly regulated and, under Federal law, some individuals are considered prohibited persons concerning firearm ownership. Firearm laws are complex, and failure to abide by them can result in fines and imprisonment. For the purposes of holding and transferring firearms there are special purpose "gun trusts".Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually and/or jointly (even if you are the initial Trustees of the Revocable Trust). For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.Additional assets may be transferred to your Revocable Trust either by registering them in the name of the Trustee, by delivering them to the Trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the Trustee, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from your Revocable Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawal. The Trust Agreement can be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement.Federal income tax returns for a Revocable Trust are not required. If the Settlors are also the Trustee or a co-Trustee, a federal tax identification number for the trust is also not necessary, and all income is reported using the Settlors' social security numbers (which becomes the Revocable Trust's taxpayer identification number). If the Settlors are not Trustees, the Settlors' social security numbers can still be used, but the Trustee must meet certain other requirements in that case. After the Settlors' death, a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the Trust.Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your trust or about the operation of the trust in the future. This memorandum is for your guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.

Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (FL)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of AttorneyMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for an individual with a spouse or partner residing in Florida. An estate plan is defined as an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during their lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of their beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, there may be a need for medical powers of attorney, financial powers of attorney, or various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options, including detailed practice notes, templates, and checklists.Initial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for the client. It is crucial for counsel to ascertain a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice for this information to be sought out prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets; personal information about things like their marriage, children, citizenship, etc.; and their desired fiduciaries.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, the attorney must consider the proper tools to carry out those objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's kit. A will enables the client to designate how their assets should be distributed after death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone and does not work for assets for which there are beneficiary designations, such as life insurance, or for jointly owned property with a right of survivorship.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement pursuant to which a settlor or grantor transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and is tasked with administering them but does so only on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts can be classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the grantor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the grantor dies. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in their estate plan (e.g., avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan will likely include provisions outlining what should take place in the event of a client's disability. A health care surrogate designation can be used to authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf. A living will is an advance health care directive that details the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in a variety of potential circumstances. Both instruments serve to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if they cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance. In addition, certain clients may benefit from guidance concerning elder law planning.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are often included as part of a client's estate plan. A power of attorney is the legal instrument by which an individual (the principal) authorizes another individual (the attorney-in-fact or agent) to make certain business, financial, and personal decisions on their behalf.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information on powers of attorney in Florida:Go to table5Current as of: 05/20/2025

Letter to Client 
Table of Contents
Dear [name of client]:I am writing regarding the [name of beneficiary] Supplemental Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year], which we have prepared for you as [settlor of the trust/trustee of the trust/both settlor and trustee of the trust].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust, and (2) address what you, as [settlor/trustee/both settlor and trustee] of the trust, need to know and think about while administering the trust. Therefore, I advise you to keep this letter for future reference. To accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the settlor and trustee must adhere to the terms of the trust agreement and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or a tax professional.The trust describes the responsibilities and the powers of the trustee(s). Since all trust documents (also called trust instruments) do not contain the same powers, the trustee must pay special attention to the language in the trust to be certain of the trustee's authority and options.This trust is a third-party supplemental needs trust. It is designed so that the family and friends of [name of beneficiary], the beneficiary of the trust, can make gifts to benefit [name of beneficiary] while preserving the right to receive government benefits. The gifts made to the trust can take many forms: cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or even personal property. Under no circumstances should any property or assets belonging to the beneficiary be transferred into the trust. If this is done, it could jeopardize the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. Also, the beneficiary has no right to demand or withdraw any assets or property from the trust.Here are some features of trust management with which you should familiarize yourself:Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust. That means it is fixed and cannot be amended or terminated, except under very limited circumstances. Also, gifts made to the trust cannot be returned. Please call me if you need to make any changes to the trust.Federal Tax Identification Number. This trust was drafted to qualify as a grantor trust. A grantor trust is a trust over which the grantor or other owner retains the power to control or direct the trust's income or assets. If the trust is a grantor trust, the trustee has the choice of reporting the annual income for federal tax purposes on either IRS Form 1041 or on the income tax return of the grantor. A grantor trust does not need its own TIN.Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the trust to be funded and in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[name of trustee], Trustee of The [name of beneficiary] Supplemental Needs Trust dated [month] [day], [year]." (Your bank may want to use a slightly different name.) If the trust is not a grantor trust, always use the trust's TIN as the identification number for bank accounts.Financial institutions often require a copy of the signed trust agreement to verify that the trust is in effect. Providing a copy of the complete trust agreement is generally unnecessary. Typically, a copy of the Certification of Trust or the first page, the executed signature pages, and the page delineating trustee powers are sufficient to demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust. Gift Tax Return. If any gift to the trust exceeds $18,000.00 in value, the donor should be instructed to complete a gift tax return (IRS Form 709) by April 15 of the following year. Please consult me concerning allocating some or all of your generation-skipping tax exemption to this trust.Taxation of Trust Income. The trustee is required to file IRS Form 1041 and Connecticut Form CT-1041 to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year following the taxable year. Although tax software is widely available for this purpose, we strongly recommend having these forms prepared by an accountant because of their complexity. Distributions from the Trust. The types of distributions that can be made to the disabled beneficiary are limited to those which will not jeopardize the benefits received from any county, state, federal, or other government agency. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support (e.g., housing, food, clothing, and medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds are available). Here are some examples of permissible distributions: automobile, computer equipment, subscriptions, travel, furniture, education (tuition, books, supplies), health insurance, life insurance, sports equipment, tickets to events. Cash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary. If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:• There are no more assets in the trust.• The disabled beneficiary dies, and the assets of the trust are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or to the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.• The beneficiary has become ineligible for public benefits, per Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.Please inform me if any of these events take place. At that time, it may be necessary to draw up a formal trust dissolution document.Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please read them and make sure you understand them. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about them.Record Keeping. It is important that the trustee keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. The settlor and the trustee will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust.
I hope this letter answered your immediate questions. If you would like further explanation of any aspect of administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.Sincerely,____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (FL)
Go to: Formal Requirements   |   Restrictions on Trust Purposes   |   Trustees and Trust AdministrationMaintainedby Jonathan E. Gopman, Nelson MullinsThis practice note discusses the requirements for creating a valid trust in Florida, including intent, identifiable property, ascertainable beneficiaries and proper execution. It also discusses restrictions on trust purposes, such as illegality and provisions in contravention of public policy. Finally, the note addresses the appointment and succession of trustees and the duties, responsibilities, and liability of trustees.For a full listing of key content related to estate plans for married or partnered people in Florida, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (FL).For a full listing of key content related to estate plans for individual people in Florida, see Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (FL).For further discussion of trusts, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (FL) and Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (FL).Formal RequirementsIntentIt is axiomatic that a settlor cannot create an express trust without the intent to do so. There is a requirement for a trust to be in writing (as discussed below), Thus, it is nearly impossible to conceive of a fact pattern where a settlor is alleged to have created an express trust by implication. Issues of intent therefore generally center on whether the settlor lacked capacity to enter into a trust, whether the creation of the trust was induced by fraud or undue influence, or whether the trust was created by mistake. See Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.03[1].The capacity required of the settlor of a trust is the same as the capacity required to make a will. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0601. If the settlor lacks capacity to convey property, then no trust arises.  Fraud, duress, undue influence, and mistake can also cause a trust to be void. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0406. See Florida Probate Code Manual § 2.05.In Florida, a trust does not have to be in writing; however, the creation of an oral trust and its terms may be established only by clear and convincing evidence. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0407. See also 55A Fla Jur Trusts § 262.Identifiable PropertyFor a valid trust to exist at common law it must hold assets (i.e., there must be a trust res or property delivered to the trustee). However, as discussed in the Reasons for Creating a Trust, unfunded revocable trusts are common. How are these concepts reconciled? Simply put, an unfunded revocable or irrevocable trust is not a valid trust. It only becomes a valid trust upon funding. Could it be problematic to have a trust that is not yet.valid? There is some concern that a trust that is not yet valid could not be effectively named as a beneficiary under a pour-over will. However, Fla. Stat. § 736.0401(1) makes it clear that if a trust instrument is validly executed, the trust may be a beneficiary under a will. There is no pre-death funding requirement for transfers of property by will in the statute. Nevertheless, as a matter of caution it is common practice to recite in the schedule of trust assets some nominal amount of money (e.g., $10) to satisfy the requirement for a res. To satisfy the delivery requirement a $10 bill is sometimes affixed to the schedule. However, affixing a $10 bill to the schedule of a trust can create problems for institutional trustees who may be prohibited under anti-money laundering policies and procedures from accepting cash transfers. In practice, the requirement of a  is unlikely to be an issue, but if a contest is anticipated, an estate planner may want to advise a settlor to fund the trust with more than a nominal sum promptly after its creation.Ascertainable BeneficiariesAnother common law rule is that a trust must have ascertainable beneficiaries to be valid. This does not mean that a trust must have current beneficiaries. A trust is valid if there are no current beneficiaries for a period and income must be accumulated for that period. However, there must be some party in a position to enforce the trust. The party enforcing the trust need not be an individual. For instance, charities or other trusts, or in theory, other legal entities, can be beneficiaries. See Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.03[2]. Additionally, animals that were living during a settlor's lifetime can be the sole current beneficiaries of trusts. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0408. See also Florida Probate Code Manual § 14.085.In contrast, a trust instrument is not required to specify a trustee. A trustee can always be appointed similar to a vacancy in the office of trustee being filled by a court proceeding.Execution Requirements (If Testamentary in Nature, etc.)Fla. Stat. § 736.0403(2)(b) states that "[t]he testamentary aspects of a revocable trust, executed by a settlor who is a domiciliary of this state at the time of execution, are invalid unless the trust instrument is executed by the settlor with the formalities required for the execution of a will in this state." The term testamentary aspects means "those provisions of the trust that dispose of the trust property on or after the death of the settlor other than to the settlor's estate." Id.; Robinson v. Robinson (In re Estate of Robinson), 720 So. 2d. 540, 541-542 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 4th Dist. 1998). This statute generally applies to trusts drafted in other states. It can be a surprise clients who move from another state to Florida because it is an exception to the general rule that a trust (and generally other legal documents) is valid if it was executed in conformity with the law of the jurisdiction in which, at its creation, the settlor was domiciled. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 736.0403(1). See also Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.04.Restrictions on Trust PurposesGenerally, a trust may be created for any purpose that is not illegal. Although historically, many trusts in Florida have successfully withstood trust contests, there are restrictions on the purpose for which a trust may be created.• Illegality. Florida trusts may be created only to the extent that the purposes of the trust are "lawful, not contrary to public policy, and possible to achieve." Fla. Stat. § 736.0105(2)(c); Fla. Stat. § 736.0404. Presumably, for example, a trust could not be used for the payment of bribes. A trust may also fail if it was settled to avoid the settlor's creditors. See e.g., Fla. Stat. § 736.0505(1); and Fla. Stat. §§ 726.105 and 726.106.• Provisions Contrary to Public Policy. While it is rare to encounter a purpose issue involving an illegality, it is not uncommon to encounter provisions that are contrary to public policy. The comment to the Uniform Trust Code provides generally that purposes that violate public policy include those that tend to encourage criminal or tortious conduct, interfere with freedom to marry or encourage divorce, limit religious freedom, or which are frivolous or capricious. See Comment to § 404, Unif. Tr. Code (Apr. 10, 2020 at p. 59), available at https://www.uniformlaws.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=73cfb939-8b5b-53f6-bc09-6323ebe26f3d&forceDialog=0 (last visited March 17, 2022). Another example of incurring a public policy issue in Florida may include a self-settled asset protection trust, as Florida law generally does not permit such trusts. Fla. Stat. § 736.0505(1).Trustees and Trust AdministrationThe selection of trustees and the administration of the trust are critical components of manifesting the intent of the settlor. Bifurcation of property ownership is the defining characteristic of a trust and as such, the trustee, as the individual holding title to the assets of the trust, maintains an active role in its administration.TrusteesGenerally, any individual, or a corporate trustee such as a bank or trust company, may serve as trustee.AppointmentThe selection of a trustee depends on a number of factors, including:• The settlor's preference• The time commitment that will be required of a prospective trustee• Conflicts that may exist between a potential trustee and one or more beneficiaries of the trust• The size, complexity, and potential risk of the assets of the trustWhile the settlor may desire an independent trustee (e.g., a corporate trustee), the prospective trustee may be reluctant to serve, for example, where the trust assets consist of real estate holdings that have not been evaluated for potential risks (e.g., environmental hazards) and such an undertaking would be cost prohibitive. More often, the size of the trust estate may not justify the fee structure of an institutional trustee. If the trust instrument nominates as trustee a bank that no longer exists, no longer accepts trust business, or refuses to administer the particular trust, and no other mechanism of filling the vacancy in the office of trustee is provided, the only solution may be to seek court appointment of a trustee. To avoid this situation the trust instrument should appoint a successor trustee or provide a provision for the last trustee, beneficiaries, or another third party to appoint a new trustee.Notably, designating a trustee does not compel that individual or entity to serve. The trustee must voluntarily qualify (i.e., formally accept appointment) before commencing to serve. The initial trustees of an inter vivos trust qualify by signing the trust instrument.  Successor trustees of an inter vivos trust accept by signing the instrument under which they are appointed, or they sign a separate instrument drafted for that specific purpose (i.e., an acceptance of trust). In all cases, proper documentation is essential to preclude any claims that a trustee is acting without due authority. Best practices further suggest preparing documentation for the acceptance of trusteeship under testamentary trusts, including any sub-trusts that may come into existence under the trust instrument after the death of the settlor. See Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.05.SuccessionIf a trust instrument designates a successor trustee or provides for a process of designating a successor trustee, there is generally no problem. However, even where a successor is not designated in the trust instrument, Florida law contains a flexible mechanism for the appointment of successor trustees to permit the beneficiaries to avoid court proceedings in many cases where a successor trustee is necessary. See Fla. Stat. §§ 736.0704(3)-(4).Regardless, when drafting a Florida trust, it is recommended that estate planners incorporate multiple layers of trustee succession provisions. To be thorough the practitioner may:• Empower the grantor to designate successors• Authorize the grantor's spouse to designate successors• Nominate a series of successor trustees, in order of priority listed, to serve as trustee• Provide that the last acting trustee may appoint a further successor• Provide that a majority of the adult beneficiaries of the trust may fill any vacancy –and–• Identify a corporate trusteeA practitioner may also nominate a trust protector to fill a vacancy. While estate planners do not typically provide for all these options, some subset of these options is advisable.The unrestricted power of a grantor or beneficiary to remove and replace trustees presents a trap for the unwary as such a power may present tax complications. See Rev. Rul. 95-58, 1995-2 C.B. 191. However, the mere power to designate successors should not be problematic. If the trust should not be included in the grantor's estate for estate tax purposes, the attorney will generally provide in the trust instrument that the grantor cannot, under any circumstances, become a trustee.Trust AdministrationEffective administration of a trust requires knowledge and understanding of the trustee's fiduciary and other duties associated with administering the trust and the responsibilities and liabilities inherent in the trustee's position.Duties of a TrusteeAs noted in the Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (FL) and Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (FL) and Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (FL) section above, one of the fundamental characteristics of a trust is the trustee's fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries. Under a fiduciary duty a trustee must act in the best interests of the beneficiaries, which requires a certain degree of selflessness. Perhaps the most famous statement regarding fiduciary duty in American jurisprudence is set forth in a New York Court of Appeals case, Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458 (1928), in which Judge Cardozo stated: "A trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior." See Meinhard, 249 N.Y. at 464.Furthermore, as the Florida Supreme Court declared:Stripped of all embellishing verbiage it may be confidently asserted that every instance in which a confidential or fiduciary relation in fact is shown to exist will be interpreted as such. The relation and duties involved need not be legal, they may be moral, social, domestic or personal. If a relation of trust and confidence exists between the parties, that is to say, where confidence is reposed by one party and a trust accepted by the other, or where confidence has been acquired and abused, that is sufficient as a predicate for relief. The origin of the confidence is immaterial.Quinn v. Phillips, 93 Fla. 805, 811 (1927) (emphasis added).The broad concept of a trustee's fiduciary duty has been divided into various individual duties, which will be discussed in more detail below. First, however, it is important to highlight one point that is often overlooked in discussions about fiduciary duties. This point is that not all fiduciaries are equal. For example, an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney is a fiduciary, however, an attorney-in-fact has no affirmative obligation to act on behalf of the principal, whereas the fiduciary who has accepted the office of trustee has agreed to such a commitment. The fiduciary duties of attorneys-in-fact originate from the law of agency, not the law of trusts, and though this has not been written about extensively, less is expected of agents than of trustees. In particular, though this issue occurs more often in other contexts than in estate planning, breaches of fiduciary duty in the agency context can generally be excused if such breaches are properly disclosed, however, in the context of a trust, disclosure alone will not suffice. Rather, informed written consent is required.Duty of LoyaltyOf the various individual duties owed by trustees, the most important is the duty of loyalty. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0802. The trustee is obligated to act with undivided loyalty to the beneficiaries. The trust must be administered solely in the interests of the beneficiaries, and not in the interests of the trustee. Fla. Stat. § 736.0802(1). See Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.07. However, the trustee is entitled to be paid reasonable compensation. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0802(7)(b). See also Administration of Trusts in Florida § 13.2.A trustee is typically prohibited from engaging in self-dealing (i.e., transactions between the trustee and the trust) for the obvious reason that the trustee cannot be relied upon to seek the best result for the trust and its beneficiaries when the trustee is on the other side of the transaction. Self-dealing is an issue under conflicts of interest. A trustee is honor-bound to avoid a conflict of interest. If, for example, a trust owns thirty percent (30%) of the stock in a company, and the trustee of that trust individually owns 30% of the stock, the mere potential for a biased vote creates a conflict of interest. Where the trustee is permitted to vote the stock held in the trust, the trustee may not vote those shares in a manner that will benefit the trustee personally unless such vote is also in the best interests of the trust and its beneficiaries.Interestingly, the evolution of modern financial institutions has led to a decreasing application of the prohibition on self-dealing and conflicts of interest. For example, a corporate trustee may want to invest the assets of the trust in mutual funds of an affiliate of the trustee. Under traditional trust law, this would be considered self-dealing, and as such, prohibited. Whether it is because of a recognition that it could well be in the best interests of the trust to permit such investments or lobbying from the financial services industry, such investments are now specifically authorized by statute. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0802(5)(a). However, unless the trust agreement provides otherwise, the trustee must choose between earning commissions on such investments or its affiliate earning its standard fees. The statute does not condone double-dipping of fees. Accordingly, many corporate fiduciaries will insist on inclusion of language in the trust agreement overriding the proscription against double-dipping of fees and authorizing a range of transactions that would otherwise constitute self-dealing transactions. It is asserted that this is done because the settlor is selecting the trustee at least in part because of the range of investments that will be made available to the trust. When drafting a trust that will name a corporate trustee, the estate planner should obtain from the trustee its preferred language early on in the drafting process to negotiate the self-dealing provisions as needed and ultimately incorporate those provisions into the trust document.Duty of CareThe next most basic individual duty a trustee owes is the duty of care, meaning the responsibility to administer the trust with the care and skill of an ordinary prudent person. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0804. If the fiduciary has particular expertise in an area, a higher standard will generally apply. See Fla. Stat. § 518.11(1)(a) and Fla. Stat. § 736.0806. For example, a trustee who is an accountant will be expected to possess knowledge of the tax law better than a trustee who is not a tax professional. Furthermore, a corporate trustee will be expected to keep impeccable records whereas an individual trustee might be excused for minor lapses in record keeping. There are two important points to consider in this context. First, prudence does not mean perfection. If a trustee makes prudent investments that do not produce a quality return, the trustee has not breached its duty of care even though the trust may have decreased in value. Second, prudence is process-driven rather than a results-driven. If the decision-making process is procedurally sound, the trustee has fulfilled the duty of care regardless of the result. Still, it may be challenging to establish a sound process. Therefore, the attorney should encourage trustee clients to document their decision-making as thoroughly as possible. Detailed minutes of trustee meetings can save the trustee from liability. Non-trust lawyers sometimes have a bias against maintaining detailed minutes because they feel that any more detail than absolutely necessary gives potential litigants fuel for lawsuits. Whether or not that is true in other contexts, it is incorrect in the context of the administration of a trust because the most important criterion for avoiding liability is the degree of attention to the decision-making process demonstrated by the trustee. See also Administration of Trusts in Florida § 2.2.Duty of ImpartialityImpartiality is another individual duty. The trustee must treat all beneficiaries fairly. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0803. See also Administration of Trusts in Florida § 2.5. Fairly, however, does not mean equally as different beneficiaries may have different needs. The trustee must give due consideration to the respective interests of the current beneficiaries and the remainder beneficiaries. For example, a current beneficiary may request a significant distribution. Justifying that the distribution is prudent (e.g., it is needed to pay the tuition for a beneficiary to attend law school and enhance the beneficiary's earning potential), however, if the distribution constitutes a significant percentage of the trust, it may unduly favor the current beneficiaries to the detriment of the remaindermen.That said, a client may wish to favor all current beneficiaries to the detriment of the interests of the remainder beneficiaries or one of the current beneficiaries to the detriment of other current beneficiaries. The estate planner may incorporate specific language in the trust instrument to permit for such preferences. For example, a trust instrument could include the following provision:Without limiting the Trustee's discretion, the Trustee may consider the needs of the Settlor's daughter as more important than the needs of other descendants of the Settlor, and the Settlor encourages the Trustee to be liberal in making distributions to the Settlor's daughter, even to the extent of distributing the entire trust principal.In a traditional trust that requires the trustee to distribute all of the trust income, the current beneficiaries may request that the trustee invest in assets that generate significant income, whereas the remainder beneficiaries would prefer the trustee invest in assets that have greater potential for appreciation. Historically, trustees have addressed the need to balance these competing interests by investing in a mixture of fixed income instruments and equities. However, modern portfolio theory deems this balanced approach inefficient and instead encourages the trustee to maximize or minimize expected return consistent with risk tolerance.Nevertheless, in a point that is widely misunderstood by beneficiaries and trustees similarly, the results of asset allocation do not dictate the trustee's distribution decisions. In other words, if a hypothetical balanced portfolio of 50% fixed income and 50% equities generates 2% annual income, however, the actual investment portfolio of the trust produces only 1.5% return, the trustee could justifiably use the power of adjustment to increase distributions to the current beneficiaries to 2% however, should not increase those distributions to 4%. Similarly, with respect to the trustee's duty of impartiality, it would be inappropriate for the trustee to invest primarily for income and distribute a windfall to the current beneficiaries.Duty to Keep Beneficiaries InformedIn theory, the duty to keep beneficiaries informed does not seem complex. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0813. See also Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.07[6]. The trustee ought to send periodic statements to the beneficiaries so they are aware of the assets held in the trust and the transactions that are occurring in the trust's account. That way, the beneficiaries can fulfill their fundamental role of enforcing the proper administration of the trust. So how does the attorney advise a client who does not want his or her children to learn about significant wealth being held in trust for their benefit so they do not lose all incentive to be productive members of society? The short answer is that, in Florida, there is not much that a trustee can do to shield this information from the beneficiaries because secrecy would constitute a breach of the trustee's fiduciary duty. A few states, however, such as Delaware and South Dakota, permit so-called silent trusts. See Del. Code Ann., tit. 30, §§ 3303 and 3339 and S.D. Codified Laws § 55-2-13.  In accordance with these statutes, the trustee may be relieved of any obligation to inform the beneficiaries of the existence of the trust or various aspects of the trust, and may be prohibited from voluntarily releasing such information. Professionals can speculate whether this is good public policy, however, certainly parents may have a valid concern. While it may be prudent to advise your client to have discussions with his or her children regarding the management of this wealth in accordance with expectations for being productive members of society, it would not be irrational to advise a concerned client to establish the trust in a state that respects silent trusts.Other DutiesThere remain a few additional individual duties that arguably come within the purview of those previously discussed yet warrant separate examination. The duty to administer the trust is one such duty. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0801; see also Kritchman v. Wolk, 152 So. 3d 628, 632 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 3d Dist. 2014) (holding that co-trustees breached their fiduciary duties by failing to carry out the terms of the trust to pay for a beneficiary's expenses to attend a university.) While this seems obvious, it may differ in the context of other fiduciary duties where there may not be an affirmative duty to act. See also Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.08.A second duty is the obligation to act within the scope of the trustee's authority. The trustee must be authorized to take an action (e.g., if the trust does not authorize distribution to a particular beneficiary until age 21, the trustee has no authority to make distributions earlier than that time). However, reexamining the duty of care, whether a trustee can take an action is only the first part of the analysis. Equally important is whether the trustee should take a proposed action. For example, the trust may authorize the trustee to invest the entire trust corpus in high yield bonds or a beneficiary's start-up business, however, either extreme is seldom prudent. Similarly, the trustee may have the authority to distribute all of the trust assets to the beneficiary, however, if the beneficiary is financially irresponsible, a distribution of all of the trust assets to the beneficiary is probably a poor decision.Responsibilities of TrusteeWhen administering a trust, the terms of the trust instrument, identity of the beneficiaries, nature of the trust assets, law governing the trust, tax status of the trust, and other circumstances all influence what specific tasks the trustee must undertake. Rarely will two different trust administrations be identical. Nevertheless, there are a few basic responsibilities that will generally apply to all trustees:• Trustees are required to take control of the trust assets. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0809. Trustees must maintain the trust assets separately and avoid commingling with such assets with their own personal assets. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0810(2). Fortunately, trustees may employ financial firms to hold investable assets (see Fla. Stat. § 736.0816(20)) and need not maintain certificated securities in a safe, which used to be commonplace.• Trustees are required to safeguard trust assets. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0809. For example, trustees should exercise prudence when choosing a custodian. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 736.0816(21)(b). Trustees should also properly insure real estate or artwork owned by the trust. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 736.0816(12).• Trustees are required to maintain clear, distinct, and accurate records for the trust. Fla. Stat. § 736.0810(1). Indeed, it is in the trustee's best interest to be an assiduous record keeper because if a beneficiary requests the trustee to submit an accounting of the trust administration, and the trustee lacks sufficient information to properly and fully account, the beneficiaries and the court may infer negative inferences that the trustee cannot rebut. See, e.g., Traub v. Traub, 135 So.2d 243, 244 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 1961) ("If the trustee fails to keep clear, distinct, and accurate accounts, all presumptions are against him and all obscurities and doubts are to be taken adversely to him.") As part of this responsibility, the trustee may need to track income and principal separately, particularly where the trust has different standards for income and principal distributions.• As fiduciaries, trustees are required to invest the assets of the trust. See Fla. Stat. § 518.11. However, trustees may delegate investment discretion to professional investment managers so long as they exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution in selecting the agent; establish the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes and terms of the trust; and review the agent's actions periodically to monitor performance and compliance with the terms of the delegation. See Fla. Stat. § 518.112(1) and Fla. Stat. § 736.0807(1).• Trustees are required to make distributions that are mandated under the trust instrument. They must also consider beneficiaries' requests for discretionary distributions when the trust instrument vests the trustee with such discretion.• Trustees must file any tax returns that are required for the trust. This can be a somewhat complicated undertaking. A trust may not have a separate filing obligation under federal law if it is a grantor trust, though depending upon the circumstances, the trustee of a grantor trust may have an obligation to file an informational return. See I.R.C. §§ 671 through 679 and I.R.C. § 6048. In terms of state filing obligations, similar to individuals, trusts may have income sourced in different states and may have to file non-resident returns in those states. Moreover, because some states classify trusts as residents based on different criteria (i.e., residence of the trustee and/or residence of the beneficiaries), a trust may be a resident of multiple states. For example, a trust established by a Florida settlor with a Delaware trustee and a California beneficiary may have to file in all three states. Additionally, if there are any international aspects to the trust, an additional set of reporting obligations may apply. For these reasons attorneys should advise their trustee clients to retain accountants who have experience preparing fiduciary income tax returns, not just personal income tax returns or business entity returns.• Trustees may be required to pursue claims on behalf of the trust (e.g., against service providers, former trustees, or even co-trustees) or defend claims against the trust. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0811. See also, Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.07.Directed TrustsFlorida by statute permits directed trusts, where, for example, a co-trustee (a general trustee) designated in the trust instrument is vested with discretion over investments or distributions, as the case may be, and the role of another co-trustee (an administrative or excluded trustee) is merely to effectuate the directions it receives from the co-trustee or other designated advisors. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0703(9). So long as the excluded trustee does not participate in willful misconduct, that trustee is not responsible for any consequence that results from compliance with the exercise of the power and does not have a duty or an obligation to review, inquire, investigate, or make recommendations or evaluations with respect to the exercise of the power. Id.Unless otherwise specified in the trust instrument, multiple trustees who are unable to reach a unanimous decision may act by majority decision. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0703(1).Liability of TrusteeFla. Stat. § 736.1001(2) empowers the court to remedy a breach of trust in numerous ways, including any of the following:• Compelling the trustee to perform the trustee's duties• Enjoining the trustee from committing a breach of trust• Compelling the trustee to redress a breach of trust by paying money or restoring property or by other means• Ordering a trustee to account• Appointing a special fiduciary to take possession of the trust property and administer the trust• Suspending the trustee• Removing the trustee as provided in Fla. Stat. § 736.0706(2)• Reducing or denying compensation to the trustee• Subject to Fla. Stat. § 736.1016, voiding an act of the trustee, imposing a lien or a constructive trust on trust property, or tracing trust property wrongfully disposed of and recovering the property or its proceeds• Ordering any other appropriate reliefSee also 55A Fla Jur Trusts § 235.A trustee who commits a breach of trust is liable for the greater of:• The amount required to restore the value of the trust property and trust distributions to what such would have been if the breach had not occurred, including lost income, capital gain, or appreciation that would have resulted from proper administration –or–• The profit the trustee made by reason of the breachSee Fla. Stat. § 736.1002(1).Generally, trustees are not personally liable for the acts of a predecessor and successor trustees do not have a duty to institute a proceeding or file any claim against any prior trustee or that trustee's estate, for any of the prior trustee's actions. See Fla. Stat. § 736.08125(1).If the settlor is particularly concerned about reducing the trustee's liability, the trust instrument may include language exonerating a successor trustee for failing to seek redress. For example, the trust instrument could include the following provision:No Trustee shall be liable at any time by reason of, or in consequence of, any acts, omissions or defaults with respect to the administration of the trust by any predecessor trustee, and no Trustee shall have any duty to examine the accounts, records and acts of any predecessor trustee or to institute any action or claim against any predecessor trustee to compel redress of any breach of trust or for any other reason.In contrast, trustees will generally be held liable for actions of a co-trustee even if they do not participate in those actions, if they knew or should have known of such actions unless they notify the co-trustee(s) of their dissent at or before the time of the action. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0703(8). See also Administration of Trusts in Florida § 18.31. Even dissenting in writing will not, however, absolve a trustee of liability for failure to prevent a breach of trust or a failure to administer the trust. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0703(7).Compensation of TrusteeTrustees are entitled to commissions for administering trusts. See, e.g., Muscogee Lumber Co. v. Hyer, 18 Fla. 698, 703-704 (Fla. 1882); Traub v. Traub, 135 So.2d 243, 244 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2d Dist. 1961). "If the terms of a trust do not specify the trustee's compensation, a trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances." Fla. Stat. § 736.0708(1). If the terms of a trust agreement do specify the trustee's compensation, the court may still make adjustments, such as when the trustee's duties are substantially different from those contemplated at trust formation, or the specified compensation would be unreasonably low or high. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0708(2). The court's right to adjust the trustee's compensation is a mandatory provision which cannot be altered by the terms of the trust. See Fla. Stat. § 736.0105(2)(q). See also Florida Estates Practice Guide § 39.11.Borrowing from Bogert, Trusts and Trustees, § 976, the Florida Supreme Court has indicated that the following factors should be considered in determining the reasonableness of a trustee's compensation, namely:• The amount of capital and income received and disbursed by the trustee• The wages or salary customarily granted to agents or servants for performing like work in the community• The success or failure of the administration of the trustee• Any unusual skill or experience which the trustee in question may have brought to his work• The fidelity or disloyalty displayed by the trustee• The amount of risk and responsibility assumed• The time consumed in carrying out the trust• The custom in the community as to allowances to trustees by settlors or courts and as to charges exacted by trust companies and banks• The character of the work done in the course of administration, whether routine or involving skill and judgment• Any estimate which the trustee has given of the value of his own services• Payments made by a beneficiary to the trustee and intended to be applied toward his compensationSee West Coast Hospital Ass'n v. Florida National Bank, 100 So. 2d 807, 811 (Fla. 1958).It is standard practice for corporate trustees to charge commissions at the published rate schedules of trustees unless there is an agreement to the contrary.Current as of: 03/31/2025End of Document

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][month] [day], [year][name of client][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:FUNDING YOUR REVOCABLE TRUSTNow that you have established your Revocable Trust ("Trust"), it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Trust, all co-owners must join in the conveyance. Please note that this letter is not intended as tax advice. You should consult your tax professional regarding the tax consequences of funding the trust with each type of asset.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer different kinds of assets to your Trust. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that generally should not be transferred to the trust during your lifetimes include retirement accounts, annuities, and life insurance policies. It is possible to name your Trust as beneficiary of these assets, but you should consult with a tax professional before changing the beneficiary designations of annuities and retirement accounts to avoid unintended tax consequences.In general, to transfer assets to your Trust, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually or as a co-owner to the Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [month] [day], [year]One of the major goals accomplished by a Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the assets at the time of your deaths. To avoid probate, it is critically important that the Trust owns the assets, which are controlled by the serving trustee, and not by your individual and/or joint names, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will directs the executor to add assets held in your individual name at your death to the trust assets to distribute as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Trust as outlined above.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I am available to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in co-ownership with another person, or transferring assets to your Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Trust. These comments are general in nature, and for specific guidance, please contact my office.Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution. The name on the account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trustee, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Brokerage Accounts. If you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's name and records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account on behalf of your Trust, and you do not own it individually. This also applies if the certificates for those assets are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name.Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund Shares. If certificates are issued in your name, both individual or jointly, new certificates must be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the Trustee during your lifetimes.Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof). These securities must also be registered in the name of the Trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed above, for bonds or debentures held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed.Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or Debentures. These securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the Trustee, so that there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. You may execute and deliver to the Trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust, listing the bearer securities for transfer. The Trustee should retain the assignment with the permanent records of the Trust. I can prepare any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. I recommend keeping bearer securities in a safe-deposit box in the name of the Trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects). Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described for unregistered securities. Any new investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the Trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the Trustee's ownership.Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership) and Other Business Interests. Business interests include, but may not be limited to, S Corporations, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), Partnerships, and similar entities. Prior to transferring any business interest into your Trust, you should meet with a tax professional to ensure that corporate documents and relevant tax law allow for such a transfer. It is also important to understand if there are any specific tax consequences resulting from such a transfer.To register partnership interests in the Trustee's name, partners may need to execute a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted.Interests in Real Property (Personal Residence, Investment Real Estate, and Mineral and Royalty Interests). Legal title must be transferred to the Trustee via an executed, notarized, and recorded deed.  In Louisiana, the trust instrument or an extract of trust (also known as Certification of Trust) should be recorded with the deed to a trust. Louisiana law allows for either the entire trust instrument or an extract to be filed along with the conveyance instrument. However, there will be times when a third party may request the entire Trust Agreement or additional terms of the Trust. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust.  It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer. Ownership of oil, gas, and mineral rights may involve leases, royalties, or a working interest in the profits of production from real property. It is important to understand the nature of ownership prior to transferring ownership to a trust.Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan Benefits. Ownership of these assets generally may not be transferred to a revocable trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the trust. Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of a succession, you may wish to transfer ownership to your Trust to give the Trustee more control over the policies in case you become disabled.Ownership of an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and other retirement accounts should not transfer to the trust. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan to name the Trustee of your Trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers and others have negative tax consequences if put into the Trust, so caution and consultation with your tax professional is advised.Once an asset transfers to the Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be managed by the acting Trustee. For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, the Trustee holds the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.Additional assets, including assets acquired in the future, may be transferred to your Trust either by registering them in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, by delivering them to the Trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of your Trust, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from your Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such a withdrawal. The Trust Agreement may be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement and applicable state law.Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your Trust or about the operation of the Trust in the future. This memorandum is for your general guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.

Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (TX)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of Attorney   |   Miscellaneous Documents & Client LettersMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in Texas. An estate plan is defined as an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during his or her lifetime or after death. The documents used by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of his or her beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, there may be a need for medical powers of attorney, financial powers of attorney, or various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options, including detailed practice notes, templates, and checklists.Initial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for him or her. It is crucial for counsel to ascertain a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice to seek out this information prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets; personal information about things like his or her children, citizenship, any prior marriage, etc.; and his or her desired fiduciaries.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, the attorney must consider the proper tools to carry out those objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's kit. A will enables the client to designate how his or her assets should be distributed after death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone and the client's ownership portion of jointly owned assets.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement pursuant to which a grantor or settlor transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and is tasked with administering them but does so only on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts can be classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the grantor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the grantor dies. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in his or her estate plan (e.g., avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan will likely include provisions outlining what should take place in the event of a client's disability. A medical power of attorney can be used to authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf. A living will is an advance health care directive that details the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in a variety of potential circumstances. Both instruments serve to ensure an individual's health-care wishes are followed if he or she cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance. In addition, certain clients may benefit from guidance concerning elder law planning.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are often included as part of a client's estate plan. A power of attorney is the legal instrument by which an individual (the principal) authorizes another individual (the attorney-in-fact or agent) to make certain business, financial, and personal decisions on his or her behalf.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information on powers of attorney:Go to table5Miscellaneous Documents & Client LettersDepending on your client's circumstances, a comprehensive estate plan may warrant the preparation of additional documents, such as one detailing the client's wishes for the disposition of their remains or a revocable transfer on death deed. While these are not always included in a standard estate plan, many practitioners incorporate them when they are relevant to the client's situation.The following Practical Guidance resources can be used to supplement a client's estate planning package:  Go to table6Current as of: 06/10/2025

Letter to Client 
Table of Contents
Dear [name of client]:I am writing regarding the [name of Donor] Charitable Lead Unitrust dated [month] [day], [year] (the "Trust"), which we [have prepared / reviewed upon your request].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust; and (2) discuss what you, as trustee of the Trust, need to address during administration of the Trust. Please keep this letter for future reference.To accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the trustee must adhere to the terms in the trust document and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or the person who prepares the tax returns for the Trust.The Trust describes the powers and duties of the trustee(s). Since not all trust documents (also called trust instruments) contain the same powers, closely review and familiarize yourself with the Trust terms to be certain of your authority, requirements imposed upon you, and options for taking action on behalf of the Trust. Reach out to me with questions about the Trust terms as you review them.The Trust is a Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust, which is designed to provide a stream of income to a donor or designated beneficiary as a fixed amount with the remaining funds being distributed to a charitable entity. Transfers to the Trust can consist of cash, bonds, shares of stock, intellectual property, or real property that is not lived in by the grantor, etc. It is important to make sure that the assets transferred to the trust will provide enough income for the required distributions.1. Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust and cannot be amended, except under limited circumstances to conform with federal or state law. Please contact me if you believe this may be an issue at any time during the administration of the trust.2. Federal Tax Identification Number. Since the trust is a non-grantor trust, you must obtain a taxpayer identification number (TIN) for the Trust from the Internal Revenue Service by filing IRS Form SS-4 or going onto irs.gov and obtaining one online. The TIN serves to keep the trust assets separate from those of the grantor and identifies the trust in bank accounts and tax returns.3. Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the trust to be in effect. Simply listing assets in Schedule A of the trust or describing the assets to be transferred to the trust anywhere in the document does not fund the trust. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[Name of trustee], Trustee of The [name of Donor] Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust dated [month] [day] [year]." (Some banks may want to use a slightly different name.)To transfer funds from checking, savings, and brokerage accounts, the TIN should be provided. A bank or brokerage firm may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers will serve to demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed, and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. A certification of trust prepared in accordance with [state] law may also sometimes be used in lieu of the entire trust agreement.To transfer real estate, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust. We can prepare the deed for the property for signature by the donor. Upon obtaining the necessary signatures, we will record the deed at the county Recorder of Deeds office. You should contact the homeowner's insurance company to notify them of the title change.4. Administration of the Trust. (a) Taxation of Trust Income. File the IRS form 5227, IRS Form 1041, and [state] income tax forms to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year after receipt of the taxable income. We strongly recommend retaining an accountant for preparation of tax returns.(b) State Requirement. Register the trust with the [State] Attorney General if it is required for a charitable trust.(c) Distributions from the Trust. The Trust was created to provide [designated recipient] an Annuity Trust amount equal to [number representing the annual Annuity Trust percentage to be paid to the designated recipient]% of the net fair market value of the assets of the trust, valued as of the trust's initial value.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.(d) Recordkeeping. Please keep detailed records of the trust assets, income, and expenditures (including the date, amount, payee, and purpose). You may be required to provide a detailed accounting of the Trust to the trust beneficiaries on a yearly basis and upon the termination of the Trust.5. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:(a) There are no more assets in the trust.(b) The unitrust period terminates.6. Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please make sure you understand them. I am happy to answer any questions you may have about them.I hope that this letter has answered your immediate questions. If you would like further explanation of any aspect of funding or administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Letter to Client 
Table of Contents
PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION[Name of client][Client's address][Date]Dear [name of client]:I am writing regarding the [name of disabled beneficiary]'s Special Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year] (the "Trust"), which we [have prepared / reviewed upon your request].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust; and (2) discuss what you, as trustee of the Trust, need to address during administration of the Trust. Please keep this letter for future reference.To accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the trustee must adhere to both the terms in the trust document and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or the person who prepares the tax returns for the Trust.The Trust describes the powers and duties of the trustee(s). Since not all trust documents (also called trust instruments) contain the same powers, closely review and familiarize yourself with all of the provisions of the Trust to be certain of your authority, the requirements imposed upon you, and your options for taking action on behalf of the Trust. Reach out to me with questions about the Trust provisions as you review them.The Trust is a First-Party Special Needs Trust, designed to hold assets while preserving [name of disabled beneficiary]'s ability to receive government benefits. The principal government benefit in Pennsylvania to which [name of disabled beneficiary] is entitled is called Medical Assistance. Assets transferred to the Trust can consist of cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or personal property, etc., but it is important to note that no additions to the trust can be made on or after the 65th birthday of [name of disabled beneficiary]. Also, once assets are transferred to the Trust, [name of disabled beneficiary] has no control of, right to demand, or ability to withdraw any assets from the Trust. Upon the death of [name of disabled beneficiary] or the termination of the Trust, the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services is entitled to be reimbursed for Medical Assistance funds distributed to him or her.1. Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust and cannot be amended, except under limited circumstances necessary to keep it in conformity with federal or state law. Please contact me if you believe this may be an issue at any time during the administration of the trust.2. Federal Tax Identification Number. Obtain a taxpayer identification number (TIN) for the Trust from the Internal Revenue Service by filing IRS Form SS-4. The TIN serves to keep the trust assets separate from those of the settlor and identifies the trust in bank accounts and tax returns. Do not use your own social security number or the disabled beneficiary's social security number. The Trust must have its own TIN. Please contact me if you would like me to obtain the TIN for you.3. Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the trust to be in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself (such as shares of stock) should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[Name of trustee], Trustee of The [Name of disabled beneficiary] Special Needs Trust dated [month] [day] [year]." (Some banks may want to use a slightly different name.)To transfer funds from checking, savings, and brokerage accounts, you will need to provide the TIN. A bank or brokerage firm may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers will serve to demonstrate to the bank or brokerage firm that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. A certification of trust prepared in accordance with Pennsylvania law may also sometimes be provided in lieu of the entire trust agreement.To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust. We can prepare the deed for the property for signature by [name of disabled beneficiary / name of guardian]. Upon obtaining the necessary signatures, we will record the deed at the county Recorder of Deeds office. You should contact the homeowner's insurance company to notify them of the title change.4. Administration of the Trust. (a) Taxation of Trust Income. The trustee must file IRS Form 1041 and Pennsylvania Form PA-41 to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year after receipt of the taxable income. We strongly recommend hiring an accountant for preparation of tax returns.(b) Distributions from the Trust. The Trust was created to provide [name of disabled beneficiary] with supplemental means of support in addition to, not as replacement of, [name of disabled beneficiary]'s government benefits. Accordingly, the types of distributions that can be made to the disabled beneficiary are limited. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support, which includes (1) housing (e.g., mortgage, real property taxes, rent, etc.); (2) utilities (e.g., gas, electricity, water, sewer, waste service, etc.) (3) food; (4) clothing; and (5) medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds are available. The government benefits are meant to cover these expenses and any payment of them using the Trust's funds could result in the loss of benefits. All distributions from the Trust are at the discretion of the trustee. Here are some examples of items for which distributions are permissible:(i) phone, cable, and internet service(ii) entertainment (e.g., concerts, museums, theater, movies, tickets to sports events, subscriptions)(iii) furniture(iv) computer hardware and software(v) education expenses unrelated to room and board (i.e., tuition, books, computers, supplies)(vi) medical equipment not covered by any other benefit(vii) travel(viii) nonfood grocery items (e.g., cleaning supplies, personal hygiene products, tissues)(ix) eyeglasses –and–(x) automobile expensesDo not distribute cash or cash equivalents directly to the beneficiary, even if it is a reimbursement or prepayment for acceptable expenditures. Instead, payments should always be made directly to third parties. Distributions also should not be made to or for the benefit of anyone other than the beneficiary.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.(c) Recordkeeping. Please keep detailed records of the trust assets, income, and expenditures (including the date, amount, payee, and purpose). You may be required to provide a detailed accounting of the Trust to the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS) upon the termination of the Trust.(d) Yearly Statement of Claims. Under Pennsylvania law, the Trust is required to contain a  provision that provides for reimbursement to the DHS, upon the death of the disabled  beneficiary, of an amount equal to the total amount of Medical Assistance paid on behalf of the trust beneficiary. You, as trustee, will receive an annual statement of claims (SOC) showing the current amount owed to the DHS. The SOC will contain a running total  of all medical bills paid on behalf of [Name of disabled beneficiary] since the execution of  the Trust.(e) Reimbursement to the DHS. If the trust is terminated or [Name of disabled beneficiary] dies, you, as trustee, must notify the SNT Depository as soon as possible, at SNT Depository, Division of Third Party Liability, P. O. Box 8486, Harrisburg, PA 17105. At that time, the SNT Depository will provide a final comprehensive SOC to you, showing the total reimbursement owed to the DHS. If the DHS will not be fully reimbursed from the Trust, a final accounting of the SNT funds should accompany the payment.5. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:(a) There are no more assets in the trust.(b) The disabled beneficiary dies and the assets of the trust, after any required reimbursement to the DHS, are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.6. Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please make sure you understand them. I am happy to answer any questions you may have about them.
I hope that this letter has answered your immediate questions. If you would like further explanations of any aspect of funding or administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.Sincerely,____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Representations and Warranties of the Depositor. The Depositor makes the following representations and warranties on which the Owner Trustee relies in accepting the Owner Trust Estate in trust and issuing the Certificate.(a) Organization and Good Standing. The Depositor is duly organized and validly existing as a [(domicile and type of entity)] with power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business as such properties are currently owned and such business is presently conducted and is proposed to be conducted pursuant to this Agreement and the Basic Documents.(b) Due Qualification. The Depositor is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, is in good standing, and has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals, in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or lease of its property, the conduct of its business and the performance of its obligations under this Agreement and the Basic Documents requires such qualification.(c) Power and Authority. The Depositor has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out its terms; the Depositor has full power and authority to sell and assign the property to be sold and assigned to and deposited with the Trust and the Depositor has duly authorized such sale and assignment and deposit to the Trust by all necessary action; and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by the Depositor by all necessary action.(d) No Consent Required. No consent, license, approval or authorization or registration or declaration with, any Person or with any governmental authority, bureau or agency is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and the Basic Documents, except for such as have been obtained, effected or made.(e) No Violation. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the fulfillment of the terms hereof do not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time) a default under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Depositor, or any material indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Depositor is a party or by which it is bound; nor result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, agreement or other instrument (other than pursuant to the Basic Documents); nor violate any law or, to the best of the Depositor's knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable to the Depositor of any court or of any federal or state regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over the Depositor or its properties.(f) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or investigations pending or, to its knowledge threatened against it before any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or other tribunal or governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over it or its properties (A) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or any of the Basic Documents, (B) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificate or the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Basic Documents, (C) seeking any determination or ruling that might materially and adversely affect its performance of its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement or any of the Basic Documents, or (D) seeking to adversely affect the federal income tax or other federal, state or local tax attributes of the Certificate.Section 2.10. Covenants of the Certificateholder. The Certificateholder agrees:(a) to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Certificate of which the Holder is the beneficial owner and of this Agreement, including any supplements or amendments hereto and to perform the obligations of a Holder as set forth therein or herein, in all respects as if it were a signatory hereto. This undertaking is made for the benefit of the Trust and the Owner Trustee; and(b) except as expressly provided in Sections 4.4. and 10.12., not to, for any reason, take any Bankruptcy Action.Section 2.11. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Trust. (a) [For so long as the Trust has a single owner for federal income tax purposes, it will, pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under section 7701 of the Code, be disregarded as an entity distinct from the Certificateholder for all federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, for federal income tax purposes, the Certificateholder will be treated as (i) owning all assets owned by the Trust and (ii) having incurred all liabilities incurred by the Trust, and all transactions between the Trust and the Certificateholder will be disregarded.(b) Neither the Owner Trustee nor the Certificateholder will, under any circumstances, and at any time, make an election on IRS Form 8832 or otherwise, to classify the Trust as an association taxable as a corporation for federal, state or any other applicable tax purpose.(c) In the event that the Trust has two or more equity owners for federal income tax purposes, the Trust will be treated as a partnership. At any such time that the Trust has two or more equity owners, this Agreement will be amended, in accordance with Section 10.1. herein, and appropriate provisions will be added so as to provide for treatment of the Trust as a partnership.]ARTICLE III. CERTIFICATE AND TRANSFER OF INTEREST. Section 3.1. Initial Ownership. Upon the formation of the Trust by the contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.5. and until the issuance of the Certificate to the initial Certificateholder, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficiary of the Trust.Section 3.2. The Certificate. The Certificate shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature of an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee. A Certificate bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefit of this Agreement, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificate or did not hold such offices at the date of authentication and delivery of such Certificate. A transferee of a Certificate shall become a Certificateholder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Certificateholder hereunder, upon due registration of such Certificate in such transferee's name pursuant to Section3.4..Section 3.3. Authentication of Certificate. Concurrently with the sale of the Receivables to the Trust pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificate to be executed on behalf of the Trust, authenticated and delivered to or upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by its chairman of the board, its president or any vice president, its treasurer or any assistant treasurer without further corporate action by the Depositor, in authorized denominations. No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, executed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee's authentication agent, by manual signature; such authentication shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. The Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication.Section 3.4. Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Certificate. The Certificate Registrar shall provide the Trust Collateral Agent with the name and address of the Certificateholder on the Closing Date. Upon any transfers of the Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall notify the Trust Collateral Agent of the name and address of the transferee in writing, by facsimile, on the day of such transfer.Upon surrender for registration of transfer of the Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.7., the Owner Trustee shall execute, authenticate and deliver (or shall cause its authenticating agent to authenticate and deliver), in the name of the designated transferee, a new Certificate dated the date of authentication by the Owner Trustee or any authenticating agent.A Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the Certificateholder or their attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by an "eligible guarantor institution" meeting the requirements of the Certificate Registrar, which requirements include membership or participation in the Securities Transfer Agent's Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other "signature guarantee program" as may be determined by the Certificate Registrar in addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, all in accordance with the Exchange Act. Each Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be canceled and subsequently disposed of by the Owner Trustee in accordance with its customary practice.No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the Certificate, but the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the Certificate.Notwithstanding the foregoing, no sale or transfer of a Certificate shall be permitted (including, without limitation, by pledge or hypothecation), and no such sale or transfer shall be registered by the Certificate Registrar to be effective hereunder, if the sale or transfer thereof increases the number of Certificateholders to more than ninety-nine (99). For purposes of determining the total number of Certificateholders, a beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, grantor trust, S corporation or other flow-through entity that owns, directly or through other flow-through entities, a Certificate is treated as a holder of a Certificate if (i) substantially all of the value of the beneficial owner's interest (directly or indirectly) in the flow-through entity is attributed to the flow-through entity's interest in the Certificate and (ii) a principal purpose of the use of the flow-through entity to hold the Certificate is to satisfy the 99 holder limitation set out above.Section 3.5. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates. If (a) any mutilated Certificate shall be surrendered to the Certificate Registrar, or if the Certificate Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the Certificate Registrar and the Owner Trustee, such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee, or [(name of Owner Trustee)], as the Owner Trustee's authenticating agent, shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.Section 3.6. Persons Deemed Certificateholder. Every Person by virtue of becoming a Certificateholder in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Prior to due presentation of the Certificate for registration of transfer, the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar, may treat the person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered in the Certificate Register as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar nor any agent of the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary.Section 3.7. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Owner Trustee shall maintain an office or offices or agency or agencies where the Certificate may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the Certificate and the Basic Documents may be served. The Owner Trustee initially designates the Corporate Trust Office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor and the Certificateholder of any change in the location of the Certificate Register or any such office or agency.Section 3.8. Disposition in Whole But Not in Part. The Certificate may be transferred in whole but not in part. Any attempted transfer of the Certificate that would divide the ownership of the Owner Trust Estate shall be void. The Owner Trustee shall cause any Certificate issued to contain a legend stating "THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE, EXCEPT UNDER THE LIMITED CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT."Section 3.9. ERISA Restrictions. The Certificate may not be acquired by or for the account of (i) an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA, (ii) a "plan" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code) that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include assets of an employee benefit plan or a plan described in (i) or (ii) above by reason of such employee benefit plan's or plan's investment in the entity, or (iv) an employee benefit plan subject to any federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (each, a "Benefit Plan"). By accepting and holding its beneficial ownership interest in its Certificate, the Holder thereof shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan.Section 3.10. Appointment of Certificate Paying Agent. The Certificate Paying Agent shall make distributions to the Certificateholder from the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to Article VIII and Article XI. hereof and shall report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee. Any Certificate Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee shall revoke such power and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee or the Depositor by written direction to the Owner Trustee determines, each in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent initially shall be [(name of Owner Trustee)], and any co-paying agent chosen by [(name of Owner Trustee)] and the Depositor. [(name of Owner Trustee)] shall be permitted to resign as Certificate Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor. In the event that [(name of Owner Trustee)] shall no longer be the Certificate Paying Agent, the Depositor, with the consent of the Owner Trustee, shall appoint a successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent appointed hereunder to execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee that, as Certificate Paying Agent, such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Certificateholder in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholder entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to the Certificateholder. The Certificate Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Certificate Paying Agent such Certificate Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Owner Trustee. The provisions of Articles VI. and VII. shall apply to the Owner Trustee also in its role as Certificate Paying Agent, for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise.ARTICLE IV. VOTING RIGHTS AND OTHER ACTIONS. Section 4.1. Prior Notice to Holder with Respect to Certain Matters. With respect to the following matters, the Owner Trustee shall not take action unless at least [30] days before the taking of such action, the Owner Trustee shall have notified the Certificateholder in writing of the proposed action and the Certificateholder shall not have notified the Owner Trustee in writing prior to the [30th] day after such notice is given that the Certificateholder has withheld consent or provided alternative direction:(a) the election by the Trust to file an amendment to the Certificate of Trust (unless such amendment is required to be filed under the Statutory Trust Statute or unless such amendment would not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Holder);(b) the amendment of the Indenture by a supplemental indenture in circumstances where the consent of any Noteholder is required;(c) the amendment of the Indenture by a supplemental indenture in circumstances where the consent of any Noteholder is not required and such amendment materially adversely affects the interest of the Certificateholder; or(d) except pursuant to Section [12.1(b)] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the amendment, change or modification of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, except to cure any ambiguity or defect or to amend or supplement any provision in a manner that would not materially adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholder.The Owner Trustee shall notify the Certificateholder in writing of any appointment of a successor Note Registrar or Trust Collateral Agent within five Business Days after receipt of notice thereof.Section 4.2. Action by Certificateholder with Respect to Certain Matters. The Owner Trustee shall not have the power, except upon the direction of the Certificateholder in accordance with the Basic Documents, to (a) remove the Servicer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement pursuant to Section [9.2] thereof or (b) except as expressly provided in the Basic Documents, sell the Receivables after the termination of the Indenture. The Owner Trustee shall take the actions referred to in the preceding sentence only upon written instructions signed by the Certificateholder and the furnishing of indemnification satisfactory to the Owner Trustee by the Certificateholder.Section 4.3. Restrictions on Certificateholder's Power. (a) The Certificateholder shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action if such action or inaction would be contrary to any obligation of the Trust or the Owner Trustee under this Agreement or any of the Basic Documents or would be contrary to Section 2.3. nor shall the Owner Trustee be obligated to follow any such direction, if given.(b) The Certificateholder shall not have any right by virtue or by availing itself of any provisions of this Agreement to institute any suit, action, or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement or any Basic Document, unless the Certificateholder previously shall have given to the Owner Trustee a written notice of default and of the continuance thereof, as provided in this Agreement, and also unless the Certificateholder shall have made written request upon the Owner Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Owner Trustee under this Agreement and shall have offered to the Owner Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Owner Trustee, for [30] days after its receipt of such notice, request, and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit, or proceeding, and during such 30-day period no request or waiver inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Owner Trustee pursuant to and in compliance with this Section or Section 5.3.. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section, the Certificateholder and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.Section 4.4. Action with Respect to Bankruptcy Action. (a) The Trust shall not, without the prior written consent of the Owner Trustee, (a) institute any proceedings to adjudicate the Trust bankrupt or insolvent, (b) consent to the institution of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against the Trust, (c) file a petition seeking or consenting to reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law relating to bankruptcy with respect to the Trust, (d) consent to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Trust or a substantial part of its property, (e) make any assignment for the benefit of the Trust's creditors; (f) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; (g) declare or effect a moratorium on its debt; or (h) take any action in furtherance of any of the foregoing (any of the above foregoing actions, a "Bankruptcy Action"). In considering whether to give or withhold written consent to a Bankruptcy Action by the Trust, the Owner Trustee, with the consent of the Certificateholder (hereby given, which consent the Certificateholder believes to be in the best interests of the Certificateholder and the Trust), shall consider the interest of the Noteholders in addition to the interests of the Trust and whether the Trust is insolvent; provided, however, that the Owner Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the Noteholders. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty to give such written consent to a Bankruptcy Action by the Trust if the Owner Trustee shall not have been furnished (at the expense of the Trust or the Person that requested that such letter be furnished to the Owner Trustee) with a letter from an independent accounting firm of national reputation stating that in the opinion of such firm the Trust is then insolvent. The Owner Trustee (as such and in its individual capacity) shall not be personally liable to any Person on account of the Owner Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Section or in connection with the Owner Trustee's giving prior written consent to a Bankruptcy Action by the Trust in accordance herewith, or withholding such consent, in good faith, and neither the Trust nor the Certificateholder shall have any claim for breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise against the Owner Trustee (as such and in its individual capacity) for giving or withholding its consent to any such Bankruptcy Action.(b) The parties hereto stipulate and agree that the Certificateholder has no power to commence any Bankruptcy Action on the part of the Trust or to direct the Owner Trustee to take any Bankruptcy Action on the part of the Trust except as provided in Sections 4.4.(a) and 10.12.. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the consent of the Trust Collateral Agent shall be obtained prior to taking any Bankruptcy Action by the Trust.(c) The provisions of this Section do not constitute an acknowledgement or admission by the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Certificateholder or any creditor of the Trust that the Trust is eligible to be a debtor, under the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq., as amended.Section 4.5. Covenants and Restrictions on Conduct of Business. (a) The Trust agrees to abide by the following restrictions:(1) other than as contemplated by the Basic Documents and related documentation, the Trust shall not incur any indebtedness;(2) other than as contemplated by the Basic Documents and related documentation, the Trust shall not engage in any dissolution, liquidation, consolidation, merger or sale of assets;(3) other than as contemplated by the Basic Documents and related documentation, the Trust shall not engage in any business activity in which it is not currently engaged; and(4) other than as contemplated by the Basic Documents and related documentation, the Trust shall not form, or cause to be formed, any subsidiaries and shall not own or acquire any asset.(b) The Trust shall:(1) maintain books and records separate from any other person or entity;(2) maintain its office and bank accounts separate from any other person or entity;(3) not commingle its assets with those of any other person or entity;(4) conduct its own business in its own name and use stationery or other business forms under its own name and not that of the Certificateholder or any Affiliate;(5) other than as contemplated by the Basic Documents and related documentation, pay its own liabilities and expenses only out of its own funds;(6) observe all formalities required under the Statutory Trust Statute;(7) not guarantee or become obligated for the debts of any other person or entity;(8) not hold out its credit as being available to satisfy the obligation of any other person or entity;(9) not acquire the obligations or securities of the Certificateholder or its Affiliates;(10) other than as contemplated by the Basic Documents and related documentation, not make loans to any other person or entity or buy or hold evidence of indebtedness issued by any other person or entity;(11) other than as contemplated by the Basic Documents and related documentation, not pledge its assets for the benefit of any other person or entity;(12) hold itself out as a separate entity from the Certificateholder and not conduct any business in the name of the Certificateholder;(13) correct any known misunderstanding regarding its separate identity;(14) not identify itself as a division (other than for tax reporting purposes) of any other person or entity; and(15) except as required or specifically provided in the Trust Agreement, the Trust will conduct business with the Certificateholder or any Affiliate thereof on an arm's length basis.(c) So long as the Notes or any other amounts owed under the Indenture remain outstanding, the Trust shall not amend this Section 4.5. unless the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied.ARTICLE V AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OWNER TRUSTEE. Section 5.1. General Authority. (a) The Owner Trustee is authorized and directed to execute and deliver the Basic Documents to which the Trust is named as a party, each certificate or other document attached as an exhibit to or contemplated by the Basic Documents to which the Trust is named as a party and any amendment thereto and on behalf of the Trust, each state business license (and any renewal thereof) prepared by the Certificateholder or Servicer, in each case, in such form as the Depositor shall approve as evidenced conclusively by the Owner Trustee's execution thereof, and on behalf of the Trust, to direct the Indenture Trustee to authenticate and deliver Class [__] Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $[__], [(revise per capital structure)]. In addition to the foregoing, the Owner Trustee is authorized, but shall not be obligated, to take all actions required of the Trust pursuant to the Basic Documents. The Owner Trustee is further authorized from time to time to take such action as the Certificateholder recommends with respect to the Basic Documents so long as such activities are consistent with the terms of the Basic Documents.(b) The Owner Trustee shall sign on behalf of the Trust any applicable tax returns of the Trust, unless applicable law requires the Certificateholder to sign such documents.Section 5.2. General Duties. It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to discharge (or cause to be discharged) all of its responsibilities pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Sale and Servicing Agreement and to administer the Trust in the interest of the Holder, subject to the Basic Documents and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged its duties and responsibilities hereunder and under the Basic Documents to the extent the Servicer has agreed in the Sale and Servicing Agreement to perform any act or to discharge any duty of the Trust or the Owner Trustee hereunder or under any Basic Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for the default or failure of the Servicer to carry out its obligations under the Sale and Servicing Agreement.Section 5.3. Action upon Instruction. (a) Subject to Article IV., the Certificateholder shall have the exclusive right to direct the actions of the Owner Trustee in the management of the Trust, so long as such instructions are not inconsistent with the express terms set forth herein or in any Basic Document. The Certificateholder shall not instruct the Owner Trustee in a manner inconsistent with this Agreement or the Basic Documents.(b) The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take any action hereunder or under any Basic Document if the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined, or shall have been advised by counsel, that such action is likely to result in liability on the part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of any Basic Document or is otherwise contrary to law.(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement or any Basic Document, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the Certificateholder requesting instruction as to the course of action to be adopted, and to the extent the Owner Trustee acts in good faith in accordance with any written instruction of the Certificateholder received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable on account of such action to any Person. If the Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within 10 days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this Agreement or the Basic Documents, as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Certificateholder, and shall have no liability to any Person for such action or inaction.(d) In the event that the Owner Trustee is unsure as to the application of any provision of this Agreement or any Basic Document or any such provision is ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set of facts, the Owner Trustee may give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the Certificateholder requesting instruction and, to the extent that the Owner Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith in accordance with any such instruction received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable, on account of such action or inaction, to any Person. If the Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within 10 days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this Agreement or the Basic Documents, as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the Certificateholder, and shall have no liability to any Person for such action or inaction.Section 5.4. No Duties Except as Specified in this Agreement or in Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, make any payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or otherwise deal with the Owner Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any document contemplated hereby to which the Owner Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms of this Agreement or in any document or written instruction received by the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 5.3.; and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or any Basic Document against the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have no responsibility for filing any financing or continuation statement in any public office at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest or lien granted to it hereunder or to prepare or file any Commission filing (including any filings required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder) for the Trust or to record this Agreement or any Basic Document. The Owner Trustee nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take all action as may be necessary to discharge any Liens on any part of the Owner Trust Estate that result from actions by, or claims against, the Owner Trustee (solely in its individual capacity) and that are not related to the ownership or the administration of the Owner Trust Estate.Section 5.5. No Action Except under Specified Documents or Instructions. The Owner Trustee shall not manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with any part of the Owner Trust Estate except (i) in accordance with the powers granted to and the authority conferred upon the Owner Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) in accordance with the Basic Documents and (iii) in accordance with any document or instruction delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 5.3..Section 5.6. Restrictions. The Owner Trustee shall not take any action (a) that is inconsistent with the purposes of the Trust set forth in Section 2.3. or (b) that, to the actual knowledge of the Owner Trustee, would result in the Trust's becoming taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. The Certificateholder shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take action that would violate the provisions of this Section.Section 5.7. Covenants for Reporting of Repurchase Demands due to Breaches of Representations and Warranties. (a) The Owner Trustee will (i) in accordance with its obligations pursuant to Section [3.2] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, provide prompt written notice upon the discovery of any breach of the Seller's representations and warranties, (ii) not later than the [fifth (5th)] Business Day of each calendar quarter, beginning [(date)], provide to the Servicer and the Seller, a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit C with respect to any requests (in writing or orally) for the repurchase of any Receivable pursuant to Section [5.1] of the Purchase Agreement or Section [3.2] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement received by a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee during the immediately preceding calendar quarter (or, in the case of the initial notice, since the Closing Date) and (iii) promptly upon reasonable written request by the Servicer or the Seller, provide to them any other information reasonably requested in good faith that is in actual possession of the Owner Trustee and necessary to facilitate compliance by them with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, and Items 1104(e) and 1121(c) of Regulation AB.(b) In no event will the Owner Trustee or the Issuer have any responsibility or liability in connection with (i) the compliance by the Servicer, the Seller or any other Person with the Exchange Act or Regulation AB or (ii) any filing required to be made by a securitizer under the Exchange Act or Regulation AB. The Owner Trustee will not have a duty to conduct any affirmative investigation as to the occurrence of any conditions requiring the repurchase of any Receivable pursuant to Section [5.1] of the Purchase Agreement or Section [3.2] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.ARTICLE VI. CONCERNING THE OWNER TRUSTEE. Section 6.1. Acceptance of Trusts and Duties. The Owner Trustee accepts the trusts hereby created and agrees to perform its duties hereunder with respect to such trusts but only upon the terms of this Agreement.

Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Owner Trust Estate or any Financed Vehicle may at the time be located, the Servicer and the Owner Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Owner Trust Estate, and to vest in such Person, in such capacity, such title to the Trust, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Servicer and the Owner Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If the Servicer shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request to do so, the Owner Trustee shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to Section 9.1. and no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to Section 9.3..Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee shall be conferred upon and exercised or performed by the Owner Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Owner Trustee joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Owner Trustee;(ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other trustee under this Agreement; and(iii) the Servicer and the Owner Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.Any notice, request or other writing given to the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Owner Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Owner Trustee and a copy thereof given to the Servicer.Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Owner Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor trustee.ARTICLE X.

The Owner Trustee shall cooperate fully with the Servicer and the Trust to deliver to the Servicer and the Trust any and all statements, reports, certifications, records and any other information necessary in the good faith determination of the Servicer to permit the Servicer and the Trust to comply with the provisions of Regulation AB, together with such disclosures relating to the Owner Trustee reasonably believed by the Servicer to be necessary in order to effect such compliance.ARTICLE XI. APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS; CERTAIN DUTIES. Section 11.1. Establishment of Trust Accounts. (a) The Owner Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholder, shall cause the Certificate Paying Agent to establish and maintain in the name of the Trust a distribution non-interest bearing account (the "Certificate Distribution Account"), bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the benefit of the Certificateholder. The Certificate Distribution Account shall be maintained as an Eligible Deposit Account.(b) The Trust shall possess all right, title and interest in all funds on deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account and in all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholder. If, at any time, the Certificate Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the Certificate Paying Agent shall within 10 Business Days establish a new Certificate Distribution Account as an Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any cash or any investments to such new Certificate Distribution Account.Section 11.2. Application of Trust Funds. (a) On each Distribution Date, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificate Paying Agent to distribute amounts deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement with respect to such Distribution Date in the following order of priority:(1) to make payments to the Certificateholder any remaining amount deposited therein; and(2) to clear and terminate the Certificate Distribution Account upon the termination of this Agreement.(b) [In the event that any withholding tax is imposed on the Trust's payment (or allocations of income) to the Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this Section. The Owner Trustee or Certificate Paying Agent is hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder sufficient funds for the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Trust (but such authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with respect to the Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed to the Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a non-U.S. Certificateholder), the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with this paragraph.(c) Any Holder of the Certificate that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date such Holder becomes a Holder, (i) shall notify the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Paying Agent and (ii)(A) provide the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Paying Agent with Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN, W-8ECI or W-8EXP (or successor forms), as appropriate, or (B) notify the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Paying Agent that it is not entitled to an exemption from United States withholding tax or a reduction in the rate thereof on payments of interest.

Trust Administration and Taxation
Go to: Trust Administration Overview   |   How to Begin a Trust Administration   |   Determining the Property Subject to Trust Administration   |   Filing and Payment of Taxes   |   Trust Accountings   |   Final Distribution of Trust AssetsMaintainedThis practice note discusses the role of a successor trustee in the process of trust administration and the filing and paying of attendant taxes. Trust administration is the manner in which the successor trustee manages trust property according to the terms of the trust after the death of the settlor of the trust. Effective trust administration calls for careful adherence to the steps involved throughout the process.This practice note will guide a successor trustee through the steps involved in trust administration, including sending notice to trust beneficiaries, inventorying and valuing the property included in the trust, filing and paying taxes, and preparing final accountings of the trust. This practice note concludes with the final distribution of trust assets to beneficiaries.For more information on this topic, see Income Taxation of Fiduciaries and Beneficiaries and Trust Administration and Taxation § 55.01. For an overview of trusts, see Tax, Estate & Financial Planning for the Elderly § 10.13.Trust Administration OverviewLiving trusts (also called revocable or inter vivos trusts) are often used as estate planning tools for those persons who wish to avoid probate of part or all of their estates upon death. A living trust is a written legal document through which the person who creates the trust (the settlor) will place assets into the trust for their benefit during their lifetime. Those same assets will be distributed to the settlor’s designated beneficiaries upon the settlor’s death.The settlor will not only name the beneficiaries of the trust property, but they will also name the person who will distribute the property to said beneficiaries at the settlor’s death according to their wishes. That person is known as the successor trustee. If you have been named as a successor trustee, then it is imperative that you familiarize yourself with the steps that make up trust administration. Basically, the area of trust administration deals with the successor trustee’s management of the trust property according to the terms of the trust document after the settlor’s death. This process will not be subject to probate.The duties of a successor trustee are time-consuming, and the trust terms will often set the compensation owed to you as a successor trustee. In the absence of specific reference to compensation within the terms of the trust, look to state law, which may provide fees for reasonable compensation.The time-consuming nature of trust administration may tempt a settlor to name more than one successor trustee to manage the trust. While there is no limit on the number of successor trustees that can be named, it would be unwise to name more than two. Keep in mind that the trustees must agree on all decisions regarding the trust and, if there are too many people involved, the trust administration may move very slowly.For an overview of trusts, see Tax, Estate & Financial Planning for the Elderly § 10.13.Advantages and Disadvantages of Trust Administration Over ProbateBefore outlining the steps that go into trust administration, it is worthwhile to briefly mention the advantages and disadvantages of opting for trust administration over probate as a means to distribute assets post-death.The advantages of trust administration mainly flow from the fact that trust administration is not a court-supervised process. No court supervision can result in the following advantages:• There will be quicker distribution of property to the beneficiaries.• There will be a greater degree of privacy as to the identity of the trust beneficiaries and the nature of the trust property.• There will be less expenses associated with property distribution.However, as we all know, if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is. There are some disadvantages to trust administration. If a dispute breaks out between beneficiaries as to the distribution of property, you as the successor trustee may find that it is much more difficult to resolve the dispute without court assistance. Also, the creditors of the decedent’s debts generally have a longer time to file claims against a trust for payment as opposed to filing a claim against a probated estate for payment of the decedent’s debts.How to Begin a Trust AdministrationThe initial step you will need to take as successor trustee will be to determine if state law requires that you notify beneficiaries and heirs of the deceased settlor as to the existence of the trust. Some beneficiaries may be aware that a trust was created by the settlor, while other beneficiaries may not be aware of the trust’s existence. Almost half of the 50 states have specific laws as to when you must notify beneficiaries and heirs and what types of information you must provide in the notice. If you are unsure as to whether your state requires notification, then you should contact a trusts and estates attorney for guidance.Who Is Entitled to Receive Notification?As mentioned above, you must first consult your state law, but in most cases, you must notify the following persons of the trust’s existence:• The qualified beneficiary of the trust• All heirs of the deceased settlorQualified beneficiaries are those who are entitled to receive property from the trust even if they are entitled to do so as an alternate or contingent beneficiary.When Must Notification Be Sent?Generally, you must send notice of the trust’s existence to the appropriate parties within 60 days of the settlor’s death. The notice that you send as a successor trustee is not a confusing legal form; it can be in the form of a straightforward letter containing the required information (see below). Again, please consult your state law for the rules on timing of the notice and any restrictions on its format.What Is Included in the Notice?The exact information that you as successor trustee must include in the notice will depend on state law requirements (if any), but at a minimum you should include the following information in the notice:• The identity of the settlor(s) of the trust• The date of the trust’s creation• The full name and address of the successor trustee• Notice that the recipient is entitled to a copy of the trust instrument• Notice of any other information that the recipient is entitled to under the terms of the trust instrument, such as an accounting (see below for more information)If you are unsure that you have included all pertinent information in the notice, please consult a trusts and estates attorney for guidance.Once the beneficiary has received notice, they will have a certain number of days to file a trust contest. The number of days will depend on state law. If the beneficiary does not choose to contest the terms of the trust within the set number of days, then they may have surrendered their right to do so in the future.Determining the Property Subject to Trust AdministrationIn order to reach the final step of trust administration—distribution of the trust property to the appropriate parties—you as successor trustee must determine what property is held by the trust. This basically comes down to real property and other trust assets.Real PropertyIf real property is held by the trust, then title must be vested in you as successor trustee so that the property can be sold, managed, or distributed according to the settlor’s wishes. The appropriate documents needed to complete the title transfer should be prepared by an attorney familiar with the process. These documents typically consist of the following:• An affidavit that should be recorded, along with a certified copy of the settlor’s death certificate, against each piece of real property held in the trust• A change of ownership form completed and recorded at the same time as the above affidavit• An exemption form if the trust is transferring property from parents to children or in any other means exempt from property tax reassessmentFor purposes of preparing an inventory of all trust property, the value of any real property should be appraised as of the settlor’s date of death.Additional Trust AssetsNow that you have identified any real property held by the trust, you should identify the other assets of the trust and have the title of those assets transferred into your name as successor trustee. Such trust assets may include investment and bank accounts. However, prior to this step you will need to acquire a federal tax identification number for the trust. This is also known as an employer identification number or EIN. You can obtain the number online through the Internal Revenue Service website or by filing Form SS-4. You must obtain this identification number so that any income the accounts earn in the trust’s name is reported to the Internal Revenue Service in the correct manner. If there are multiple trusts involved in the trust administration, then you must obtain an identification number for each trust.After you have obtained the identification number for the trust, you should have all trust accounts transferred to your name as successor trustee, using the trust’s new identification number. Do not use your personal social security number, or you may find yourself liable for tax on income earned by the trust!Once this is completed, you should make a list of all the trust assets and their value. For trust assets that prove difficult to value, employ the services of an appraiser.For more information on this topic, see Modern Estate Planning § 22.32.Filing and Payment of TaxesDepending on the terms of the trust instrument, part of your role as successor trustee may be to file:• An estate tax return for the deceased settlor• The deceased settlor’s final federal and state (if applicable) income tax returnsSuccessor trustees are also responsible for filing the federal and state (if applicable) income tax returns for the trust (the fiduciary income tax returns).To determine what taxes must be paid, it is crucial that you as the successor trustee make an inventory of what assets are included in the trust, what assets pass outside of the trust, what assets are subject to probate, and what assets are included in the deceased settlor’s estate.Federal Estate Tax ReturnUnder the terms of the trust, you may, as successor trustee, be responsible for paying any estate taxes that are owed by the deceased settlor’s estate. If that is the case, then it is prudent to consult with an estate planning attorney or financial planner to determine if estate tax is due and, if so, to prepare and file the federal estate tax return, Form 706. For a complete discussion of how to calculate estate tax, see the practice note titled Federal Estate Tax Return.Form 706 must be filed and the estate tax paid within nine months from the date of the deceased settlor’s death. Keep in mind that sometimes estate assets must be liquidated to pay the estate tax due. If this is the case, then you must liquidate within the nine-month period. For more information on filing the federal estate tax return and paying the tax, see Modern Estate Planning § 67.01. Note that due to the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the IRS issued a memorandum on December 11, 2020 allowing taxpayers and representatives to use electronic or digital signatures when signing IRS Form 706. This memorandum applies to IRS Forms 706 that are signed and postmarked from January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021.Final Income Tax Returns of Deceased SettlorAgain, depending on the terms of the trust, the successor trustee may be responsible for filing the deceased settlor’s final federal and state (if state income tax applies) income tax returns. The form to be used for filing the final federal income tax return for the decedent is Form 1040. If a state tax return is required, consult your state division of taxation website for the appropriate form.You must file the final income tax return(s) for the year in which the deceased settlor died (i.e., January 1st until date of death), and the return is due on the date the settlor would have been required to file the return had he or she lived (i.e., April 15th of the year after death). For a complete discussion of filing a final federal income tax return of a decedent, see Modern Estate Planning  § 68.01.Fiduciary Income Tax ReturnsYou as the successor trustee are responsible for the filing of income tax returns (federal and state, if applicable) for the trust for any year in which the trust has gross income of $600 or more. The federal income tax return for a trust (the fiduciary income tax return) is Form 1041 and must be filed by April 15th following the close of the trust’s taxable year. For state forms, consult the state division of taxation website.If trust income is distributed to beneficiaries during the taxable year, the successor trustee must distribute Form 1041, Schedule K-1 to each beneficiary. The schedule will show the beneficiary their share of the trust income and where to report the income on their individual tax returns.For a complete discussion of filing and paying the federal income tax return of the trust, see Modern Estate Planning §§ 22.31 to 22.32. For more information see also Income Taxation of Fiduciaries and Beneficiaries.Trust AccountingsUpon the death of the settlor of the trust, you as the successor trustee may be required to provide the trust beneficiaries with a formal trust accounting at least annually, upon the trust termination, or if there is a change in the successor trustee. Consult state law, if applicable, and the terms of the trust to determine if, and when, you should provide an accounting and what the accounting should contain. The accounting may include the following:• Statements regarding assets and liabilities of the trust• Statements regarding receipts and disbursements of the trust• Statements regarding any agents hired on behalf of the trust and their compensation• Statement of the successor trustee’s compensationA beneficiary may choose to waive the successor trustee’s duty to account. This waiver must be made in writing. Any non-waiving beneficiaries are still entitled to receive accountings. However, a court may choose to reinstate the successor trustee’s obligation to account to a waiving beneficiary if there is a question of wrongdoing in the trust administration.For more information on this topic see, Modern Estate Planning § 22.32.Final Distribution of Trust AssetsThe final rung on the ladder of trust administration is the distribution of the trust assets according to the terms of the trust. The terms of the trust may direct that the assets of the trust be directly distributed outright to the named beneficiaries. However, sometimes the terms of the trust may call for the successor trustee to set up sub-trusts to hold assets in trust for certain beneficiaries. As a successor trustee, you must ensure that any sub-trusts are adequately funded according to the trust terms.When the assets are ready to be distributed, and any sub-trusts are ready to be funded, it is good practice to consult a trusts and estates attorney to prepare a trust distribution agreement to send to all beneficiaries for their signature. Examples of provisions contained in such an agreement are:• The asset distribution terms of the trust• A description of the funding of any sub-trusts• A description of the final distribution plan• Consent of beneficiaries to the final distribution plan• Waivers of accountingThis document can serve to acknowledge approval of your actions as the successor trustee throughout the trust administration process by the trust beneficiaries and to protect you as the successor trustee against any future litigation by trust beneficiaries.Current as of: 12/28/2024End of Document

Grantor Trust Rules and Tax Considerations
Go to: Trusts, Fiduciaries, and Beneficiaries   |   Grantor of a Trust   |   Grantor Trusts and Reporting   |   Optional Reporting Methods   |   Filing Method ChangeMaintainedThis practice note discusses the grantor trust rules found in sections 671 through 679 of the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.). A trust constitutes a grantor trust if the grantor retains certain power or ownership benefits over the trust. Remember that this power can also relate to only a portion of the trust. Generally, the rules ignore the grantor trust for purposes of U.S. federal income tax income. Instead, grantors report the income, deductions, etc., on their  Form 1040.To help understand the grantor trust rules, this practice note first explains the role of trusts, fiduciaries, and beneficiaries. The practice note then discusses different types of trusts—domestic, simple, and complex. Finally, the practice note explains grantor trust reporting, including optional methods depending on whether the entire trust or just part of the trust constitutes a grantor trust.For a full list of key content pertaining to the federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax, see Estate, Gift, and Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Taxes Resource Kit.For more information on trusts, see Trust Administration and Taxation and Trust Fiduciary or Accounting Income.Trusts, Fiduciaries, and BeneficiariesTo be able to identify a grantor trust arrangement, best practices dictate that you understand the foundational principles of a trust, fiduciaries, and beneficiaries. You should beware that a trust is a three-party agreement whereby the founder of the trust, referred to as the donor or grantor, transfers legal title of property to a trustee, who operates as a fiduciary. The role of the fiduciary is to safeguard the trust property for a third party, known as a beneficiary. The fiduciary manages the trust on behalf of a beneficiary (who holds beneficial title to the property) all the while safeguarding the grantor’s intent with respect to the instrument.In general, you compute the taxable income of a trust in the same way you compute the taxable income for an individual. If you represent the fiduciary, or one of the joint fiduciaries, remember to advise them to file IRS Form 1041 for a domestic trust taxable under I.R.C. Section 641 if it has:• Any taxable income for the tax year• Gross income of $600 or more regardless of taxable income –or–• A beneficiary who is a nonresident alienYou should categorize two or more trusts as one trust if the trusts have the same grantor(s), substantially the same primary beneficiary or beneficiaries, and a principal purpose of the trusts’ existence involves the avoidance of tax.Domestic TrustsYou should categorize a trust as a domestic trust if a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust. In addition, if one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust (control test). See Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-7.Best practices dictate that you treat a trust as a domestic trust (other than a trust treated as wholly owned by the grantor) that existed on August 20, 1996 and elected to continue to be treated as a domestic trust. In the event your domestic trust becomes a foreign trust, then the rules under I.R.C. Section 684 dictate that you treat the trust as having transferred all its assets to a foreign trust, except to the extent a grantor or another person is treated as the owner of the trust when the trust becomes a foreign trust. For more information on foreign trusts, see Nonresident Alien Estate and Gift Tax Fundamentals.Simple TrustsUnder the U.S. federal income tax rules, you categorize trusts as either simple or complex. You should ensure that your trusts meet the following qualifications during the tax year to qualify as a simple trust:• The instrument that defines the trust must require the trust to distribute all its income currently for the taxable year to its beneficiaries. • The trust instrument must not provide that any amounts be paid, permanently set aside, or used in the taxable year for charitable purposes.• The trust must not make any distributions other than that of current income.Be aware that if a trust does not meet any one of the above requirements, the U.S. federal income tax rules consider it a complex trust. Furthermore, remember that the I.R.C. treats all trusts as complex in their final year because they must distribute principal.Also, be mindful to apply the trust rules on a yearly basis. Your trust may be a simple trust in 2025, but a complex trust in 2026.Example. If the trust instrument states that you may accumulate trust income in 2025, but in 2026 income is required to be currently distributed and no other amounts are distributed, then the trust is a complex trust in 2025 and a simple trust in 2026.Complex TrustsIn categorizing a trust as a complex trust, the rules dictate that complex trusts are trusts that do not qualify as simple trusts. Complex trusts can generally accumulate income and distribute amounts other than current income. They can also make deductible payments for charitable purposes under I.R.C. Section 642(c). Under the terms of a complex trust, the trustee has more discretion to either distribute income or hold it within the trust. See I.R.C. § 661.Grantor of a TrustOne of your first steps in evaluating a grantor trust is the identification of the grantor, who is also known as the trustor, settlor, or creator. The grantor includes any person who creates the trust relationship or directly or indirectly makes a gratuitous transfer of property to a trust. Be mindful that the term “property” includes cash. Note that if a person creates or funds a trust on behalf of another person, then the rules treat both persons as grantors of the trust. Be advised that if you create a trust, but you do not make a gratuitous transfer to that trust, then you are not treated as the owner of the trust. See I.R.C. §§ 671 through 677 or 679.Also, the rules do not treat a person who funds a trust with an amount that is directly reimbursed to such person within a reasonable period and who makes no other transfers to the trust that constitute gratuitous transfers as an owner of any portion of the trust. See I.R.C. §§ 671 through 677 or 679; see also Treas. Reg. § 1.672(f)-5(a).You should advise your grantor that their role in establishing the trust instrument includes outlining the relationship between the grantor, the trustee, and the beneficiary. Your grantor should outline the following:• The rights, duties, and powers of the trustee• The distribution provisions• The ability of the grantor to amend, modify, revoke, or terminate the trust agreement• The rules regarding the designation and selection of a trustee or successor trustees -and-• The designation of the state under which the terms and provisions of the trust agreement are to be governedSee Treas. Reg. § 1.671-2(e).Revocable TrustsYou classify all revocable trusts as grantor trusts. You also refer to revocable trusts as living trusts. Your grantor has the power to alter or cancel the provisions of a revocable trust. Be mindful that a revocable trust uses the grantor’s social security number for identification. Grantors report the trust income on their tax returns.For information on using revocable trusts in light of the changes made to the Federal Estate, Gift and Generation-Skipping Transfer Taxes by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, see Impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Federal Estate.Irrevocable TrustBe mindful that the rules dictate that irrevocable trusts cannot be altered or terminated without the permission of the beneficiary or beneficiaries. When forming an irrevocable trust, the grantor transfers assets into the trust and surrenders all ownership rights. Plan to obtain an alternate federal tax identification number if you are the grantor of an irrevocable trust.Grantor Trusts and ReportingBe mindful that a trust is a grantor trust if the grantor retains certain power or ownership benefits over the trust. Remember that this power can also relate to only a portion of the trust. Generally, the rules ignore the grantor trust for purposes of U.S. federal income tax income. Instead, your grantors report the income, deductions, etc., on their  Form 1040.Remember that if only a portion of the trust is a grantor type trust, indicate both grantor trust and the other type of trust on IRS Form 1041. For example, your trust may be a grantor trust as well as a simple or complex trust. You should acknowledge that characterization by checking either simple or complex trust on the first page of IRS Form 1041.You should evaluate the different types of filing methods. The instructions to IRS Form 1041 outline a standard filing method and three optional methods (i.e., optional method 1, optional method 2, and optional method 3).This practice note will first assist in how to report on grantor type trusts that use the non-optional method, it will then describe the three optional reporting methods.Reporting When Entire Trust is Grantor TrustTo ensure proper compliance with grantor trust reporting, be aware of the following procedures if your entire trust is a grantor trust. Proceed by filing in only the entity information of Form 1041. You should not show any dollar amounts on the form, but rather, show dollar amounts only on the attachment to the form. You should not use Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) as the attachment.Reporting When Part of the Trust is a Grantor Trust Best practices dictate that you evaluate your grantor trust. If only part of the trust is a grantor type trust, the portion of the income, deductions, etc., that is allocable to the non-grantor part of the trust is reported on Form 1041, under normal (non-optional) reporting rules. The amounts that are allocable directly to the grantor are shown only on an attachment to the form.Grantor Trust AttachmentYou should now prepare the grantor trust attachment. Best practices dictate that you provide the name, identifying number, and address of the person(s) to whom the income is taxable. You then give the amount of income of the trust that is taxable to the grantor or another individual under I.R.C. Sections 671 through 678. Be mindful to report any deductions or credits applicable to this income. Advise grantors that they must report the income, deductions, or credits applicable to this income on  personal income tax return.Example. Trust A is a grantor type trust. In 2025, the trust sold 100 shares of Company A stock for $1,010 in which it had a basis of $10 and 200 shares of XYZ stock for $10 in which it had a $1,020 basis. Trust A should not report these transactions on Form 1041. Instead, advise Trust A to prepare a schedule and attach that schedule to Form 1041. Be mindful the schedule should show each stock transaction separately and in the same detail as the grantor and owner should report these transactions on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets and Schedule D (Form 1040). The trust does not net the capital gains and losses, nor does it issue the grantor and owner a Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) showing a $10 long-term capital loss. This example is based on an example present in the instructions to Form 1041.Your trust return preparer does not report these transactions on IRS Form 1041. Instead, you attach a schedule to IRS Form 1041 showing each stock transaction separately and in the same detail that the grantor and trust owner will need to report these transactions on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets and Schedule D (Form 1040).Revenue Ruling 2023-2 and Basis Adjustments At the end of March 2023, the IRS and Treasury issued Revenue Ruling 2023–2 regarding I.R.C. Section 1014 basis adjustments and defective grantor trusts. The Revenue Ruling poses the question whether there is a basis adjustment under I.R.C. Section 1014 to the trust in cases where the individual owner of the trust dies, and the assets are not included in the individual owner’s estate for estate tax purposes. The facts of the revenue ruling involve an irrevocable grantor trust funded with assets the transfer of which was a completed gift for gift tax purposes.  I.R.C. Section 1014(b) lists the seven types of property that are considered to have been acquired from or to have passed from the decedent for purposes of Section 1014(a), including, “[p]roperty acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, or by the decedent’s estate from the decedent.” I.R.C. § 1014(b). Revenue Ruling 2023-2 holds that the assets do not fall into any of the seven categories; therefore, the basis of the assets is not adjusted. Put another way, the IRS determined that the basis “step-up” under I.R.C. Section 1014 does not apply to assets gifted to an irrevocable grantor trust by completed gift in cases in which such assets are not included in the gross estate of the owner of the trust for federal estate tax purposes. Under Revenue Ruling 2023-2, the basis of the assets in the grantor trust immediately after the grantor’s death is the same as immediately prior to the death.Optional Reporting MethodsGenerally, if the rules treat your trust as owned by one grantor or other person, the trustee may choose optional method 1 or optional method 2 as the trust's method of reporting instead of filing Form 1041.Under optional method 1 and optional method 2, spouses will be treated as one grantor if both of the following apply:• The rules treat the entire trust as owned by the spouses • The spouses file their income tax return jointly for that tax yearIf the rules treat a trust as owned by two or more grantors or other persons, the trustee may choose optional method 3 as the trust's method of reporting instead of filing Form 1041.You should note the following exceptions. If your trust falls under the following categories, then you cannot report using the optional filing methods:• A common trust fund (See I.R.C. § 584(a))• A foreign trust or a trust that has any of its assets located outside the United States• A qualified subchapter S trust (See I.R.C. § 1361(d)(3))• A trust all of which is treated as owned by one grantor or one other person whose tax year is other than a calendar year• A trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons, one of whom is not a U.S. person• A trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons if at least one grantor or other person is an exempt recipient for information reporting purposeso	 Note that there is an exception in a scenario where at least one grantor or other person is not an exempt recipient and the trustee reports without treating any of the grantors or other persons as exempt recipientsOptional Method 1If you represent a trust treated as owned by one grantor or by one other person, you should advise your trustee to provide all payers of income during the tax year the name and tax identification number of the grantor (or other person treated as the owner of the trust) and the address of the trust. You should only use this method if the owner of the trust provides the trustee with a signed Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. In addition, be advised that unless the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust is the trustee or a co-trustee of the trust, the trustee must give the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that:• Shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust• Identifies the payer of each item of income• Explains the way the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when determining the grantor's or other person's taxable income or tax –and–• Informs the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on the grantor’s income tax returnRemember that grantor trusts that have not applied for an employee identification number and are going to file under optional method 1 do not need an employee identification number for the trust if they continue to report under that method.For more information on employee identification numbers, consult the IRS website on Employer ID Numbers.Optional Method 2If you are consulting on a trust treated as owned by one grantor or by one other person, best practices dictate that the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name, address, and tax identification number of the trust. The trustee also must file with the IRS the appropriate Forms 1099 to report the income or gross proceeds paid to the trust during the tax year that shows the trust as the payer and the grantor, or other person treated as owner, as the payee. Remember that the trustee should report each type of income in the aggregate and each item of gross proceeds separately. See the IRS website detailing the instructions for 1099-Misc for further explanation.In addition, unless the grantor, or other person treated as owner of the trust, is the trustee or a co-trustee of the trust, the trustee must give the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that:• Shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust• Explains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor's or other person's taxable income or tax –and–• Informs the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on the grantor’s income tax returnNote that this statement satisfies the requirement to give the recipient copies of the Forms 1099 filed by the trustee.Optional Method 3For a trust treated as owned by two or more grantors or other persons, the trustee must give all payers of income during the tax year the name, address, and tax identification number of the trust. The trustee also must file with the IRS the appropriate Forms 1099 to report the income or gross proceeds paid to the trust by all payers during the tax year attributable to the part of the trust treated as owned by each grantor, or other person, showing the trust as the payer and each grantor, or other person treated as owner of the trust, as the payee. The trustee must report each type of income in the aggregate and each item of gross proceeds separately.In addition, the trustee must give each grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust a statement that:• Shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust attributable to the part of the trust treated as owned by the grantor or other person• Explains how the grantor or other person treated as owner of the trust takes those items into account when figuring the grantor's or other person's taxable income or tax –and–• Informs the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust that those items must be included when figuring taxable income and credits on the grantor’s income tax returnNote that this statement satisfies the requirement to give the recipient copies of the Forms 1099 filed by the trustee.Filing Method ChangeIf you represent a trustee who previously had filed IRS Form 1041, be advised the trustee can change to one of the optional methods by filing a final Form 1041 for the tax year that immediately precedes the first tax year for which the trustee elects to report under one of the optional methods. On the front of the final Form 1041, the trustee must write “Pursuant to section 1.671-4(g), this is the final Form 1041 for this grantor trust,” and check the Final return box in item F.Current as of: 12/22/2024End of Document

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][month] [day], [year][name of client][address]  RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:FUNDING YOUR REVOCABLE TRUSTNow that you have established your Revocable Trust, it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Revocable Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Revocable Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the trust during your lifetimes include IRAs and some types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trusts, you will need to transfer the title for each asset out of its current ownership and into the name of the trustee of the Revocable Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [month] [day], [year]One of the major goals accomplished by a Revocable Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the trust assets at the time of your death. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets be owned by the serving Trustee of the Revocable Trust and not by you individually and/or jointly, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as outlined above.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own name (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings InstitutionThe name on the account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trustee, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Brokerage AccountsIf you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account, and you do not own it individually. This also applies to certificates for those assets that are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name.Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund SharesIf certificates are issued in your name, either individually or jointly, new certificates must be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate in order to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the Trustee during your lifetime.Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof)These securities must also be registered in the name of the Trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed above, if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed.Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or DebenturesThese securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the Trustee, so that there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be accomplished by executing and delivering to the Trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust listing the bearer securities being transferred, which will be retained by the Trustee with the permanent records of the trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. It would be helpful to keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the Trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects)Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Revocable Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described for unregistered securities. Any new investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the Trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the Trustee's ownership.Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership)In order to register these partnership interests in the Trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted.Interests in Real Property (Personal Residence, Investment Real Estate, and Mineral and Royalty Interests)Legal title must be transferred to the Trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a Special Warranty Deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan BenefitsOwnership of these assets generally may not be transferred to a Revocable Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the trust. Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, you may wish to transfer ownership to your Revocable Trust to give the Trustee more control over the policies in case you become disabled. Ownership of IRAs should not be transferred to the trust. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan Trustee to name the Trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if put into the Revocable Trust, so caution is advised.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually and/or jointly (even if you are an initial Trustee of the Revocable Trust). For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.Additional assets may be transferred to your Revocable Trust either by registering them in the name of the Trustee, by delivering them to the Trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the Trustee, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from your Revocable Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawals. The Trust Agreement can be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement.Federal income tax returns for a Revocable Trust are not required. If a Grantor is also the Trustee or a co-Trustee, a federal tax identification number for the trust is also not necessary, and all income is reported using the Grantors' social security numbers (which becomes the Revocable Trust's taxpayer identification number). If the Grantors are not Trustees, the Grantors' social security numbers can still be used, but the Trustee must meet certain other requirements in that case. After the Grantors' death, a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the Trust.Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your trust or about the operation of the trust in the future. This memorandum is for your guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.Sincerely yours,____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Revocable Trust for Individual with Spouse or Partner 
[client name] REVOCABLE TRUSTI, [client name], [also known as [aka]], as settlor, residing in [city], Florida (hereinafter referred to in the first person), establish the [client name] REVOCABLE TRUST (the "Trust") on this [month] [day], [year]. [client name] is the trustee of this Trust, and collectively with [his/her/their] successors, is referred to in this Trust Agreement as the "Trustees".W I T N E S S E T H:WHEREAS, I desire to establish this trust (the "[client name] Revocable Trust" or the "Trust") for my benefit and protection in the event of my incapacity, and to provide for the disposition of property on my death to my family;WHEREAS, I transfer to the Trustees the property listed in Schedule A (the "Trust Estate"), and may transfer additional property thereto from time to time, either during my life, or pursuant to beneficiary designation or otherwise on my death, to be held and administered by the Trustees pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Trust Agreement; andWHEREAS, the Trustees agree to accept this Trust Agreement, to hold the Trust Estate as set forth in this Trust Agreement, and to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof.NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:ARTICLE I. FAMILY INFORMATION.I [am married to/live in a committed domestic partnership with] [full legal name of spouse or partner and aliases] and any reference to my [spouse or partner] shall be to [him/her/them]. I have [number (e.g., four)] children, namely, [full legal names of children and aliases]. Any reference to "my children" shall be to my children named in this Article, and to any children of mine born or adopted after execution of this Trust. Any reference to "my descendants" shall be to my children and their descendants, including adopted descendants.ARTICLE II. TRUST DURING MY LIFE.2.1. During my life, the Trustees shall hold, manage, invest, and reinvest the Trust Estate, and shall collect the income thereof, and shall liberally distribute so much of the net income and principal of the Trust to me, or apply for my benefit, as the Trustees shall determine in their absolute discretion for my best interests. The Trustees shall accumulate any undistributed income and add the same to the principal of the Trust.2.2. The rights of the successor beneficiaries hereunder shall be considered secondary. The Trust is established to ensure that the best available care and support is provided to me to meet all my lifetime needs and wants. All assets of the Trust are to be considered available for that purpose, and the Trustee shall at all times be guided by that purpose and intent.2.3. The Trustees shall make every effort to involve me in decision-making regarding both financial matters and personal care. The Trustees shall make every effort to determine my wishes and make decisions that conform to them. If I am unable to make my wishes known, the Trustees shall make decisions that the Trustees believe that I would make, bearing in mind that the least restrictive alternatives for living arrangements are desirable so that I may live with the greatest degree of dignity possible. The Trust is to be used to provide me with the best available care and support during my lifetime.2.4. During my lifetime, I am a beneficiary of this Trust and I may reside on any real property held in the Trust for my lifetime and may claim the homestead exemption available to that real property pursuant to Section 196.031 and 196.041(2) of the Florida Statutes, and to qualify said real property as my homestead pursuant to Article X, Section 4 of the Florida Constitution, as amended. For that purpose, my interest in such property is an interest in real property and not personal property.ARTICLE III. DISTRIBUTIONS ON MY DEATH.Upon my death:3.1. The Trustees may, in their sole and absolute discretion, pay to or on behalf of my estate such amounts as may be needed for the payment of my funeral expenses, expenses of last illness, and expenses of administering my estate, subject to the limitations of Florida Statutes Section 733.707 regarding the order of payment of expenses and claims. Such payments may be made directly to the taxing authorities or other persons entitled thereto or to the personal representatives of my estate. The Trustees shall have no duty or obligation to determine the correctness, validity, propriety, or amount of any such taxes or expenses or to see to the proper use or disposition of any such payment. The Trustees shall have no liability for any such payment made in good faith or pursuant to the request or instructions of the personal representatives of my estate. Any decision made by the Trustees as to the amount and manner of any payments authorized or directed to be made by this Article shall fully protect the Trustees and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons interested in the Trust. However, if any life insurance proceeds, other death benefits, or any other property that are exempt from claims of creditors become payable to this Revocable Trust or my estate, those proceeds may be made available for the payment of taxes and expenses of administration of my estate, but shall not be used for the payment of claims and debts against my estate.3.2. The Trustees shall distribute all of the tangible personal property held or received by the Trustees at the time of my death, not given by a separate written list as provided in my will, as follows:(a) Such property shall be distributed to my [spouse or partner], if my [spouse or partner] survives me. If my [spouse or partner] does not survive me, such property shall be divided among my children who survive me, in such manner as they may agree. If my children cannot reach an agreement with respect to the disposition of such property within ninety (90) days after my death, or if any such child is then a minor or otherwise under a legal disability, then such property shall be divided by the Trustees in as nearly equal shares as practical.(b) Each beneficiary of tangible personal property under this section shall be entitled to any claims in my favor existing at my death with respect to the property distributed to such beneficiary, and, to the extent practical, shall be entitled to any insurance policies relating to such tangible personal property. Any costs of distribution of any tangible personal property, including, without limitation, storage, insurance, packing, and delivery, shall be paid out of my general estate as an administrative expense.3.3. The balance of the Trust Estate, after the payment of any debts (other than debts secured by mortgages on real estate or loans on life insurance policies), expenses and taxes, including any property mentioned above but not effectively disposed of ("my Residuary Trust Estate"), shall be distributed as follows:(a) If my [spouse or partner] survives me, I give my Residuary Trust Estate, real and personal, to my [spouse or partner] outright and free of any trusts.(b) If my [spouse or partner] does not survive me, I give the balance of my Residuary Trust Estate to my descendants who survive me, per stirpes, outright and free of any trusts.ARTICLE IV. PAYMENT OF DEATH TAXES.4.1. All estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, generation-skipping or other wealth transfer taxes (other than any additional estate tax imposed by Code Sections 2031(c)(5)(C), 2032A(c) or 2057(f), any generation-skipping transfer tax on any generation-skipping transfer other than a direct skip or any comparable tax imposed by any other taxing authority) that result from my death and that are imposed by any domestic or foreign taxing authority as a result of my death, but only to the extent imposed upon property passing under my Will or this Trust Agreement, together with interest and penalties on those taxes, shall be charged against and paid without apportionment out of my Residuary Trust Estate as an administration expense. Such taxes on property not passing under this Trust Agreement or my Will shall be apportioned to and paid from such property by those succeeding to such property, taking into account the provisions of any instrument governing such property, the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and any provisions of other applicable law apportioning such taxes.4.2. Notwithstanding the above, the following clarifications and/or modifications of the general rule set forth in the preceding Article shall apply:(a) All taxes generated by my Residuary Trust Estate shall be apportioned within my Residuary Trust Estate to the share or shares generating the tax but shall not be apportioned between current and future interests, such as a life estate and remainder, even if one and not the other is taxable.(b) Any generation-skipping transfer tax (other than a tax on a direct skip of property passing as part of my Residuary Trust Estate and disposed of under this Trust Agreement prior to the disposition of my Residuary Estate) shall be charged to the property constituting the transfer in the manner provided by Code Section 2603(b).ARTICLE V. THE TRUSTEES.5.1. I am the initial Trustee of the trusts created hereunder. If I am Unavailable, I appoint my [spouse or partner] as Trustee. If my [spouse or partner] shall be Unavailable, I appoint [names of successor co-trustees], or the survivor of them, as Trustees. If both [names of successor co-trustees] shall be Unavailable to act as Trustee, then I appoint [name of second successor trustee], as Trustee. When capitalized in this Trust Agreement, the term "Unavailable" shall mean the appointed or then acting Trustee cannot serve or continue to serve because the Trustee or appointee has for any reason resigned, been removed, become incapacitated, failed to act, failed to qualify, or has died.5.2. A Co-Trustee may be appointed by a then serving Trustee (the "appointing Trustee") at any time when only one Trustee is serving. Any appointment of a Co-Trustee hereunder shall be made by an instrument in writing.5.3. The last acting sole Trustee for whom there is no named successor, whether named in this Trust Agreement or named pursuant to procedures prescribed in this Trust Agreement for the selection of successors, may designate an institution with fiduciary trust powers as successor Trustee, to succeed such individual sole Trustee in the event that they shall cease to act as Trustee for any reason whatsoever. Any such designation shall be made by an instrument in writing, executed by such designator during their lifetime (which they may alter from time to time).5.4. In the event of a complete vacancy in the office of Trustee or the receipt of a notice of resignation from any Trustee such that a complete vacancy would result, then the oldest beneficiary to whom current trust income shall or may then be distributed, or the natural or legal guardians of such beneficiary, shall have the power to appoint an institution with fiduciary trust powers as Trustee of such trust.5.5. The Trustees shall adhere to the limitations imposed on the Trustees in Article.III..5.6. I order and direct that no Trustee shall be required to give any bond or other security for the proper discharge of their duties as a Trustee.5.7. All Trustees shall receive reasonable compensation for the duties performed in accordance with this instrument and any trusts created hereunder. Reasonable compensation for an individual Trustee is such fees as, from time to time, are recognized in the area as ordinary and reasonable for the service performed. Reasonable compensation for a bank or trust company shall be in accordance with its published fee schedule in effect at the time the services for which the fee is charged are performed, and if no such fee schedule is in effect, such fees as, from time to time, are recognized in the area as ordinary and reasonable for the service performed.5.8. Any Trustee may resign as a Trustee hereunder without prior approval of any court, by delivering to each Co-Trustee then serving (or if no Co-Trustee is then serving, to the successor Trustee who has accepted the appointment), as the case may be, myself as Settlor (if then living), and to each and every adult beneficiary, a written notice of such resignation. Such resignation shall take effect upon the date stated in the notice, whereupon all duties of the resigning Trustee shall cease, other than the duty to account; a determination that an individual Trustee is incompetent shall be deemed a resignation, by said Trustee, as of the date of that determination.5.9. I may, by a written instrument, remove any Trustee serving hereunder, or any Trustee named to serve under Article V., Section 5.1., and appoint one or more individuals or a Qualified Corporate Fiduciary (as defined in Article IX., Section 9.10.) to replace or succeed any Trustee who is removed or who ceases to act as Trustee under this Trust Agreement. I may also, by a written instrument, appoint one or more Co-Trustees to serve with any successor Trustee named to serve under Article V., Section 5.1..ARTICLE VI. TRUSTEE POWERS.The Trustees shall have, in addition to all other powers incident to their respective offices of Trustees, in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion, the following rights, powers and authority, subject only to express provisions to the contrary contained in this Trust Agreement, namely:6.1. To receive additional property from any source and to add it and mingle it with any trust created hereunder;6.2. To invest and reinvest the principal of the Trust in stocks, common, preferred or any other class, in bonds, secured or unsecured, and in other securities, in foreign exchange, in mutual funds, in common trust funds, in commodities, equities, mortgages (including mortgages on any property owned by any income beneficiary hereunder), real estate, business enterprises, mineral rights, mine projects, investments in the nature of loans, or other properties of any kind, whether foreign or domestic without regard to the proportion which such property or property of a similar character so held may bear to the entire trust and whether or not such stocks, bonds, securities or other properties are of the nature approved for fiduciaries by the present or future laws or statutes applicable thereto; accordingly, the Trustee may, but need not, favor retention of assets originally owned by me prior to contribution to this Trust, and the Trustee shall not be under any duty to diversify investments, regardless of any rule of law requiring diversification, and any such duty is hereby waived; the Trustee may retain and acquire property that does not produce income, subject to any restrictions or qualifications of this power set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement;6.3. To hold a part or all of the Trust in cash for a reasonable period of time; to purchase and hold for periods of time non-income producing securities and other property upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee may determine; to take out and maintain life insurance and health insurance policies on any income beneficiary or the spouse or descendants of any income beneficiary hereunder and life insurance policies on my life;6.4. To purchase, sell, exchange, lease, mortgage, grant options upon, abandon, demolish, alter, repair in an ordinary or extraordinary manner, to sell, purchase and exercise rights and options, or otherwise deal with any real or personal property in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the Trustees shall deem proper to make, execute and deliver all proper instruments for said purposes; any lease made by the Trustees may extend beyond the period fixed by statute for leases made by fiduciaries and beyond the duration of any Trust;6.5. To partition, without sale, any real or personal property held jointly or in common with others or distributable to one or more persons hereunder and to pay or receive consideration to effect equality of partition; to unite with any other owner in the management, leasing, use or improvement of any property;6.6. To amortize or not amortize premiums; to create reserves for depreciation and obsolescence, or wasting assets; to allocate receipts and disbursements between income and principal, notwithstanding that such allocations may contravene law or custom which would otherwise be applicable, so long as such allocation is, in its discretion, not unreasonable;6.7. To borrow money from anyone, including a Trustee, for any purpose, in connection with the administration of my estate, and to assign as collateral security therefor any property forming a part of the Trust; to continue any existing loans, to renew or modify any existing contracts or agreements entered into by me during my life, and to continue any business in which I was a stockholder, partner, or proprietor at the time of my death;6.8. To compromise any and all claims, debts, accounts, and causes of action in favor of or against the Trust and to give receipts and acquittances therefor;6.9. To retain accountants, agents, attorneys, investment advisors (except in the case of a corporate fiduciary), and such other persons as the Trustee may deem advisable in the administration of the trust and to make such payments therefor as the Trustee may deem reasonable, whether on an annual retainer basis or otherwise, and to delegate to such person any discretion which the Trustee may deem proper, including by way of illustration and not limitation, discretion delegated to an investment advisor to make purchase and sales with prior consultation; the fact that the Trustee shall be retained in such other capacity shall in no way affect a Trustee's right to receive reasonable compensation for a Trustee's services in such other capacity in addition to a Trustee's statutory commissions for acting as Trustee;6.10. To enter into pooling arrangements and voting trust agreements; to participate in reorganizations; to grant proxies, to deposit property with protective committees; to register securities in the names of nominees, insofar as permitted by law; to participate as a limited partner in private investment partnerships, notwithstanding that said participation may be irrevocable for a period of up to one (1) year, and notwithstanding that under the partnership agreement, limited partners may have no voice in the investment of partnership assets;6.11. Out of the proceeds of any insurance policies, pension plan, profit sharing plan or individual retirement account death benefits held hereunder, the Trustee may, in the Trustee's sole and absolute discretion, purchase assets from my estate or loan assets to my estate at their fair market value. The propriety of the purchase, the nature and amount of the assets so purchased, and the ascertainment of fair value shall be solely within the discretion of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall incur no liability as a result of such purchase or purchases even though such assets are not investments in which the Trustee is authorized by law or by any rule of court to invest trust funds;6.12. Without limitation by specification of the following, the Trustee is expressly authorized and empowered, without any charge of self-dealing and without any increase or decrease in its responsibility and liability, to exercise any and all of the powers, authorities and discretions provided hereunder in respect of any securities issued by a corporation or in respect of any other business interest in which the Trustee, as a stockholder, officer, director, partner, employee or otherwise, has a financial interest, and in respect of any securities issued by a corporate executor and the Trustee or a corporation of which a corporate executor and the Trustee is a subsidiary;6.13. To make distribution of the Trust in kind and to cause any share to be composed of cash, property or undivided fractional shares in property different in kind from any other shares and for that purpose to determine the values thereof, so far as permitted by law and by other provisions of this Trust; to determine that any property is worthless or of insufficient value to warrant keeping or protecting and to abandon any such property or to convey the same with or without consideration;6.14. To invest the assets of multiple trusts in a single fund if the interests of the trusts are accounted for separately;6.15. To merge any trust created hereunder with any other trust or trusts created by me, if any, under will or deed (if the terms of any such trust are then substantially similar and held for the primary benefit of the same persons);6.16. After my death, to make voluntary contributions of funds held in this Trust in its discretion to any other trust of mine, if any, under will or deed, either on its own initiative or at the request of any trustee of such other trust; provided, however, in no event is the Trustee under any legal or other obligation to initiate such contribution or to comply with any request that may be made;6.17. All rights, powers and duties, discretionary or otherwise, herein conferred upon Trustee shall continue after termination of any trust created hereunder and until complete distribution thereof;6.18. To allocate any portion of my exemption under Section 2631(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to any property as to which I am the transferor, including any property transferred by me during life as to which I did not make an allocation prior to [his/her/their] death;6.19. To divide property in any trust being held hereunder with an inclusion ratio, as defined in Section 2642(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, of neither one hundred percent (100%) nor zero into two separate trusts representing two fractional shares of the property being divided, one to have an inclusion ratio of one hundred percent (100%) and the other to have an inclusion ratio of zero;6.20. To join with my [spouse or partner], or [his/her/their] estate, or governing revocable trust, in the execution and filing of any federal income tax return for the year in which my death occurred and for any years prior thereto, and also to consent to any gifts made by [him/her/them] as being made by me for the purposes of the federal gift tax laws; and the executors of my estate or the Trustees may take such action even though it may result in additional liabilities for my estate. Any income or gift taxes due on such returns and any deficiency, interest or penalties thereon shall be allocated in such manner between my estate and my said [spouse or partner] or [his/her/their] estate, or all to any of them as the executors of my estate or the Trustees in their sole and absolute discretion shall deem equitable and proper;6.21. To make all tax elections and allocations the Trustees may consider appropriate, including any election to treat this revocable trust as part of my estate for income tax purposes, even though a Trustee may have an interest affected by the election, except where a Trustee is prohibited from participating in the election by another provision of this Trust Agreement; provided, however, this authority is exercisable only in a fiduciary capacity and may not be used to enlarge or shift any beneficial interest except as an incidental consequence of the discharge of fiduciary duties. Tax elections and allocations made in good faith shall not require equitable adjustments; and6.22. I authorize Trustees to:(a) Access, use, and control my digital devices, including, but not limited to, desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, peripheral storage devices, mobile telephones, smart phones, cryptocurrency wallets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and any similar digital device or asset which currently exists or may exist as technology develops or such comparable items as technology develops with the purpose of accessing, modifying, deleting, controlling, or transferring my digital assets.(b) Access, modify, delete, control, and transfer my digital assets, whether or not the Trustees are the original users of such digital assets, including, but not limited to, any and all of my emails, email accounts, digital music, digital photographs, digital videos, hotel points, airline miles, software licenses, social network accounts, file-sharing accounts, financial accounts, domain registrations, DNS service accounts, web hosting accounts, tax preparation service accounts, online store accounts, affiliate programs, other online accounts, and similar digital items which currently exist or may exist as technology develops or such comparable items as technology develops.(c) Access any of my electronically stored information.(d) Access the content of any communication that has been electronically stored by the service provider for that communication or that is carried or maintained by the service provider for that communication.(e) Access any record or other information pertaining to me with respect to that service.(f) I direct that the terms used in this authorization are to be construed as broadly as possible and that this authorization of access be construed as my lawful consent under the Florida Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act; Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended; the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, as amended; and any other applicable Federal or state data privacy law or criminal law.ARTICLE VII. TRUST ADMINISTRATION.In the administration of any trust created hereunder, I direct that:7.1. Any instrument executed by the Trustees shall bind all parties interested in the Trust, including the Trust beneficiaries. No person, including any insurance company and any Trustee of a retirement benefit plan, transferring property or funds to the Trustees shall be required to see to the application of such property or funds;7.2. The Trustees may release any power, authority, or discretion conferred upon the Trustee by the provisions of this instrument or by law, by filing a written disclaimer with the beneficiaries of the Trust;7.3. The Trustees shall not be liable for any act performed by them in good faith or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law, save only for their individual acts of willful misconduct, and shall be fully protected in any course of conduct taken in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel;7.4. A successor Trustee shall not be personally liable for any act or omission of any predecessor Trustee. Any successor Trustee acting under this instrument may accept the Trust assets delivered to them by or on behalf of their predecessor Trustee as constituting the entire trust estate, and the successor Trustee shall not be required to take any action to recover further assets or to investigate any acts done by any predecessor Trustee, nor shall any successor Trustee be required to bring any action to determine what constitutes the Trust Estate or to obtain possession thereof. A successor Trustee may continue to hold assets received from the predecessor Trustee in the same manner as though the assets had been originally deposited with the successor under this instrument;7.5. Until the Trustees receive written notice of any death or other event upon which the right to payments from any trust hereunder may depend, the Trustees shall incur no liability for disbursements made in good faith to persons whose interests may have been affected by that event. Any notices or other communication required or permitted by this instrument to be delivered to or served on the Trustees shall be deemed received by the Trustee when personally delivered to the Trustees, or, in lieu of such personal delivery, when deposited in the United States mail, certified mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the Trustee at their business or personal address;7.6. Any person may rely on a copy or portion of this Trust Agreement provided by me or Trustees under a certification of trust to be a true copy or portion of this Trust Agreement. Anyone may rely on any statement of fact certified by anyone who appears from the original copy or portion of the Trust instrument or a certified copy or portion thereof to be a Trustee hereunder;7.7. During my life while I am not incompetent the Trustees are not required to provide accountings to me or any other beneficiary. During my life while I am incompetent the Trustees shall render an accounting to my guardian at least annually. After my death, unless waived by a beneficiary as provided in Fla. Stat. § 736.0813, the Trustees shall render an accounting to the qualified beneficiaries of the Trust at least annually. Nothing herein, however, shall preclude the Trustees from providing accountings more frequently than annually whenever they deem advisable. If the situs of the Trust is moved to a jurisdiction that requires judicial settlement of the account, I hereby waive such requirement, any rule or statute of law to the contrary notwithstanding.7.8. The Trustees may distribute any income or principal of the Trust to a minor by distributing it to any appropriate person chosen by the Trustee (who may be a Trustee), as custodian under any appropriate Uniform Transfers (or Gifts) to Minors Act, to be held for the maximum period of time allowed by law. The Trustees may also sell any asset that cannot legally be held under this custodianship and invest the sales proceeds in assets that can be held under this custodianship;7.9. If, pursuant to the provisions of this instrument, disposition of property is made conditional upon a beneficiary surviving another person and there is an alternate disposition if the beneficiary fails to survive, that alternate disposition shall govern if the beneficiary and that other person die under such circumstances that there is no sufficient evidence that they died otherwise than simultaneously;7.10. After my death, with regard to each trust herein, the administration thereof:(a) Each trust shall be a spendthrift trust to the maximum extent permitted by law and no interest in any trust hereunder shall be subject to a beneficiary's liabilities or creditor claims, assignment or anticipation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Article shall prevent the appointment of an interest in a trust through the exercise of a power of appointment;(b) All benefits granted to a beneficiary under this instrument shall be the separate property of such beneficiary (as distinguished from marital property, community property, quasi-community property or any other form of property as to which such beneficiary's spouse might have a claim or interest arising out of the marital relationship under the law of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign). All benefits granted to a beneficiary hereunder shall also be free of any interference from, or control or marital power of, their spouse. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "benefits" shall include real or personal property, tangible or intangible, and the provisions of this paragraph shall apply not only to benefits actually paid to any beneficiary but also to trust property allocated to a trust in which the beneficiary possesses an interest hereunder;7.11. The fact that a Trustee is active in the investment business shall not be deemed a conflict of interest, and purchases and sales of investments may be made through a corporate Trustee or through any firm of which a corporate or individual Trustee is a partner, member, shareholder, proprietor, associate, employee, owner, subsidiary, affiliate or the like. Property of a trust hereunder may be invested in individual securities, mutual funds, partnerships, private placements or other forms of investment promoted, underwritten, managed or advised by a Trustee or such a firm;7.12. In making any allocations or distributions to any beneficiary, the Trustees may make such allocations or distributions wholly in kind or in money, or partly in kind and partly in money, and may allocate and/or distribute different property interests to distributees and may do so without making pro rata allocations or distributions of specific assets; and the choice, relative values and relative federal income tax bases of the property or money so divided, allocated or distributed shall, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, be binding and conclusive on everyone interested therein; and they shall in no event be accountable for any error of judgment or discretion in exercising the power and authority herein conferred;7.13. The title, powers, duties, immunities, and discretion herein conferred upon the Trustee shall continue after the termination of the trust until final distribution;7.14. Subject to the limitations described in Article VIII., and the authority to delegate powers in the paragraph immediately below, in circumstances where the Trustee is more than one individual or entity (or one of each), then the Trustee shall exercise and perform every power (including discretionary powers), authority, or duty only by the unanimous vote of all individuals and entities serving as the Trustee if two Trustees are serving and by the majority vote of all individuals and entities serving as Trustee if more than two Trustees are serving. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if I am serving as Trustee with one or more individuals or entities, I may act alone in exercising and performing every power (including discretionary powers), authority, or duty; 7.15. Subject to the limitations described in Article VIII., any individual or entity serving as a Trustee may, by a signed instrument, and with the consent of any other individual or entity serving as a Trustee, delegate to that other Trustee, all or any portion of the powers, discretions, and duties vested in [him/her/them] by this Trust Agreement or by law, including any power, discretion, or duty which would not, absent this section, be delegable; provided, however, that this section shall not be construed to permit any power, discretion, or duty to be delegated to a Trustee who is expressly foreclosed from participating in the exercise of such power, discretion, or duty pursuant to any provision under this Trust Agreement, including but not limited to those described in Article IX., or to permit the delegation of any power, discretion, or duty specifically reserved to a particular Trustee;7.16. The situs of the trust shall be Florida. In the sole and absolute discretion of the Trustees, the location of the situs of the Trust may be transferred to such other jurisdiction as to provide for ease of administration or minimization of taxation. Upon any such transfer of situs, the Trust may thereafter, at the election of the Trustees, be administered exclusively under the laws of (and subject, as required, to the exclusive supervision of the courts of) the jurisdiction to which it has been transferred. Accordingly, if the Trustees of any trust created hereunder elect to change the situs of any such trust, said Trustees are hereby relieved of any requirement of having to qualify in any other jurisdiction and of any requirement of having to account in any court of such other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the above, no Trustee with a beneficial interest in the Trust shall participate in any action described above;7.17. The Trustees (other than any Trustee who has a beneficial interest in the trust) may, by an instrument in writing, amend the administrative provisions (including without limitation amendments to minimize taxes, protect assets from a beneficiary's creditors, and establish a beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits) of any trust created hereunder in any manner the Trustees determine in its discretion will help achieve my planning goals. The determination of the Trustees as to whether a provision is administrative, and identification of my planning goals, shall be conclusive as to all beneficiaries. No amendment under this Article may increase the class of beneficiaries or give any beneficial interest or economic benefit in any trust to any person not already a beneficiary of this Trust; and7.18. The trusts created hereunder shall be perpetual to the fullest extent permitted by governing law. If any trust created hereunder is deemed to be subject to the law of a jurisdiction that has a Rule Against Perpetuities or similar rule which limits the period during which property may lawfully be held in trust, then the trust shall terminate in all events upon the expiration of the longest period that property may be held in trust hereunder under the law of such jurisdiction (including any applicable period in gross, such as twenty-one (21) years or ninety (90) years). However, if the jurisdiction has a Rule Against Perpetuities or similar rule that applies only to certain types of property held in trust, such as real property, the foregoing sentence shall apply only to such property. If under the law of such jurisdiction the longest period that property may be held in trust may be determined (or alternatively determined) with reference to the death of the last survivor of a group of individuals who are in being at the time that the applicable period with respect to the application of the Rule Against Perpetuities or similar rule commenced, those individuals shall consist of all of my descendants who were in being at the time such Rule Against Perpetuities period or similar rule commenced.ARTICLE VIII. LIMITATION ON POWERS.Notwithstanding any provision of this Trust Agreement to the contrary, the following shall apply:8.1. With respect to distributions from any Trust by a Trustee:(a) No Trustee shall have the power to make discretionary distributions of either principal or income other than limited by an ascertainable standard to or for the benefit of the Trustee, the Trustee's estate, or the creditors of either;(b) No Trustee shall have the power to make discretionary distributions of either principal or income to satisfy any of the trustee's personal legal obligations for support or other purposes;(c) No Trustee shall have the power to make discretionary allocations in the Trustee's personal favor of receipts or expenses as between income and principal, unless such Trustee has no power to enlarge or shift any beneficial interest except as an incidental consequence of the discharge of such Trustee's fiduciary duties; and(d) No Trustee shall have the power to exercise any of the powers proscribed by this Article VIII., Section 8.1. with regard to an individual, other than the Trustee, to the extent that such individual could exercise a similar prohibited power in connection with a trust that benefits the Trustee.8.2. If any trust created under this Trust Agreement contains a power proscribed under Article VIII., Section 8.1., the power may be exercised by the remaining individuals and/or entities serving as the Trustee who are not so prohibited as if they were the only Trustee. Accordingly, it is my intent that any beneficiary serving as Trustee shall not participate in the discretionary distribution of any income or principal to that Trustee as a beneficiary. If there is no Trustee in office who can exercise such power, then subject to the provisions of this Article, the Trustee shall resign as Trustee, or another Trustee shall be appointed pursuant to this Trust Agreement, to exercise such proscribed power.8.3. No beneficiary of a trust, in an individual, trustee or other capacity, may remove a trustee and appoint a trustee who is related or subordinate to the beneficiary within the meaning of Code Section 672(c) to replace the removed trustee.8.4. No Trustee shall have any power, incident of ownership, or right of any kind relating to any life insurance policy on their life held as part of any trust with respect to which they are acting as one of the Trustees.8.5. No holder of any special power of appointment shall have any power to appoint any property to the extent that such appointment would satisfy any legal obligations of support of such powerholder.8.6. The limitations imposed on Trustees by this Article shall not apply to me to the extent the Trust is revocable and therefore included in my taxable estate for estate tax purposes.ARTICLE IX. INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION.9.1. This Trust is revocable. I expressly reserve the right, by signed instruments duly acknowledged and delivered to the Trustee during my life, to withdraw property from this trust in any amount and at any time; add other property to the Trust; alter or amend all or any part of the provisions of this Trust Agreement; and revoke this Trust Agreement in its entirety or any provision or amendment therein. These powers are personal in nature and may not be exercised on my behalf by my duly appointed attorney-in-fact or agent.9.2. Should any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement be for any reason invalid, the invalidity thereof shall not affect any of the other provisions of this instrument, and all invalid provisions hereof shall be wholly disregarded.9.3. Where appropriate, except where the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural, and words of any gender shall not be limited to that gender.9.4. Unless otherwise stated in this Trust Agreement:(a) The terms "child" and "children" refer to the immediate offspring of the named parent.(b) The term "descendant" means the descendants in any degree from a common ancestor.(c) A legally adopted child (and any descendants of that child) will be regarded as a descendant of the adopting parent only if the petition for adoption was filed with the court before the child's eighteenth (18th) birthday. If the legal relationship between a parent and child is terminated by a court while the parent is alive, that child and that child's descendants will not be regarded as descendants of that parent. If a parent dies and the legal relationship with that deceased parent's child had not been terminated before that parent's death, the deceased parent's child and that child's descendants will continue to be regarded as descendants of the deceased parent even if the child is later adopted by another person.(d) An infant in gestation who is later born alive will be deemed to be in being during the period of gestation for the purpose of qualifying the infant, after it is born, as a beneficiary of this Trust.9.5. For all purposes under this instrument, a person shall be deemed "incompetent" if and so long as a guardian or conservator of their person or estate duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction continues to serve, or upon certification by two physicians (licensed to practice under the laws of the state where the person is domiciled) that such person is unable properly to care for [himself/herself/themselves] or for their person or property.Each individual who signs this agreement or an acceptance of trusteeship hereunder, by so signing:(a) Agrees to cooperate in any physical or mental examination necessary to carry out the provisions of this section,(b) Waives all provisions of law relating to disclosure of confidential medical information insofar as that disclosure would be pertinent to any inquiry under this section, and(c) Agrees that the obligations under this paragraph shall be specifically enforceable.9.6. Property that is to be divided among an individual's surviving or then living descendants, per stirpes, shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are children of the individual who are then living or who have died leaving surviving or then living descendants. A share allocated to a deceased child of the individual shall be divided further among such deceased child's surviving or then living descendants in the same manner.9.7. A direction that a Trustee or other person "shall" take an action means that such Trustee or other person shall have no discretion in deciding whether or not to take such action, except that a direction that the Trustee shall make a distribution of income, principal, or both for "any purpose" or under any specific standard shall require the Trustee to make that distribution only if the Trustee first determines that the standard has been met. A statement that the Trustee or other person "may" do something shall give the Trustee or other person absolute and uncontrolled discretion whether or not to do such thing, exercisable by the Trustee or other person alone and subject to correction by a court only if the statement is directed towards a Trustee and such Trustee should act in bad faith, in violation of specific provisions of this Trust, or in violation with the Trustee's fiduciary duties.9.8. A provision that directs or permits the Trustee to distribute income, principal, or both, for a beneficiary's "health", "education", "support", or "maintenance", or any combination of these purposes, shall be construed consistently with the meaning given to those terms by applicable federal estate and gift tax laws, so that such a standard is for federal estate and gift tax purposes, an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the possessor. However, the holder of such an authority shall have the greatest discretion possible consistent with these tax rules.9.9. All tax-related terms shall have the same meaning in this Trust that they have in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All references to the "Code" shall be to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.9.10. The Term "Qualified Corporate Fiduciary" shall refer to any bank, trust company, or other institution authorized by applicable law to be appointed and to act as trustee or otherwise under this Trust.9.11. This Trust Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which taken together shall be deemed the original thereof.9.12. Except as otherwise provided in this Trust Agreement, all references in this Trust Agreement to Articles refer to an article or sub-article, as the case may be, of this Trust Agreement.

Letter to Client 
[Month Day, 20__][name of client][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:FUNDING YOUR REVOCABLE TRUSTNow that you have established your Revocable Trust, it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Revocable Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Revocable Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the trust during your lifetimes include IRAs and some types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trusts, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually or jointly to the Revocable Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [Month Day, 20____]One of the major goals accomplished by a Revocable Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the trust assets at the time of your deaths. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets be owned by the serving Trustee of the Revocable Trust and not by you individually and/or jointly, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as outlined above.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings InstitutionThe name on the account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trustee, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Brokerage AccountsIf you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's name and records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account and you do not own it individually. This also applies if the certificates for those assets are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name.Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund SharesIf certificates are issued in your name, both individual or jointly, new certificates must be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, in order to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the Trustee during your lifetimes.Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof)These securities must also be registered in the name of the Trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed above, if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed.Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or DebenturesThese securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the Trustee, so that there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be accomplished by executing and delivering to the Trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust, listing the bearer securities being transferred, which will be retained by the Trustee with the permanent records of the trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. It would be helpful to keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the Trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects)Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Revocable Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described for unregistered securities. Any new investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the Trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the Trustee's ownership.Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership)In order to register these partnership interests in the Trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted.Interests in Real Property (Personal Residence, Investment Real Estate, and Mineral and Royalty Interests)Legal title must be transferred to the Trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a General Warranty Deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan BenefitsOwnership of these assets generally may not be transferred to a Revocable Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the trust. Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, you may wish to transfer ownership to your Revocable Trust to give the Trustee more control over the policies in case you become disabled. Ownership of IRAs should not be transferred to the trust. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan Trustee to name the Trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if put into the Revocable Trust, so caution is advised.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually and/or jointly (even if you are the initial Trustees of the Revocable Trust). For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.Additional assets may be transferred to your Revocable Trust either by registering them in the name of the Trustee, by delivering them to the Trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the Trustee, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from your Revocable Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawal. The Trust Agreement can be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement.Federal income tax returns for a Revocable Trust are not required. If the Settlors are also the Trustee or a co-Trustee, a federal tax identification number for the trust is also not necessary, and all income is reported using the Settlors' social security numbers (which becomes the Revocable Trust's taxpayer identification number). If the Settlors are not Trustees, the Settlors' social security numbers can still be used, but the Trustee must meet certain other requirements in that case. After the Settlors' death, a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the Trust.Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your trust or about the operation of the trust in the future. This memorandum is for your guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.Sincerely yours,_____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (OH)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of Attorney   |   Miscellaneous Documents & Client LettersMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in Ohio. An estate plan is defined as an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during his or her lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of his or her beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, there may be a need for advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, or various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options, including detailed practice notes, templates, and checklists.Initial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for him or her. It is crucial for counsel to ascertain a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice for this information to be sought out prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets; personal information about things like his or her children, citizenship, any prior marriage, etc.; and his or her desired fiduciaries.The following Practical Guidance resource will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, the attorney must consider the proper tools to carry out those objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's kit. A will enables the client to designate how his or her assets should be distributed after death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement pursuant to which a grantor transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and is tasked with administering them but does so only on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts can be classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the grantor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the grantor dies. Note, however, that testamentary trusts are not listed in this section; rather, they are included in some of the will forms listed above. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in his or her estate plan (e.g., avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan will likely include provisions outlining what should take place in the event of a client's disability. An advance directive can be used to authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf. A living will is an advance health care directive that details the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in a variety of potential circumstances. Both instruments serve to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if he or she cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance. In addition, certain clients may benefit from guidance concerning elder law planning.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are often included as part of a client's estate plan. A power of attorney is the legal instrument by which an individual (the principal) authorizes another individual (the attorney-in-fact or agent) to make certain business, financial, and personal decisions on his or her behalf.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information on powers of attorney:Go to table5Miscellaneous Documents & Client LettersDepending on your client's circumstances, a comprehensive estate plan may warrant the preparation of additional documents, such as one detailing the client's wishes for the disposition of their remains, along with various correspondences related to their estate plan. While these are not always included in a standard estate plan, many practitioners incorporate them when they are relevant to the client's situation.The following Practical Guidance resources can be used to supplement a client's estate planning package:  Go to table6Current as of: 06/10/2025

Voting Trust Agreement 
This Voting Trust Agreement (“Agreement”) dated [date], is by and between the owners of common shares of [name of corporation], a New York Corporation, hereinafter called “The Company”, as may become parties to this agreement in the manner provided herein; and [name of trustee], [name of trustee], and [name of trustee], as trustees, hereinafter called the “Voting Trustees”; and [name of depository] Bank and Trust Company; a New York corporation, hereinafter called the “Depository.”Whereas the Company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, authorized to issue common shares without nominal or par value, of which there are issued and outstanding upwards of [number of shares] shares, andWhereas in order to insure the continuity of management and policy of the Company, the Shareholders of the Company becoming parties hereto desire to deposit their shares with the Voting Trustees hereunder,Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises it is agreed as follows:1. Transfer of shares by shareholders. Any holder of common shares of the Company may at any time become a party to this Agreement by transferring to the Voting Trustees the common shares of the Company held by such Shareholder and delivering to the Depository as agent of the Voting Trustees the certificates for such shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by proper instruments of assignment and transfer thereof in blank duly executed and in every case properly stamped for transfer, if so required by the Voting Trustees, and by their acceptance in respect thereof of a certificate or certificates issued under this Agreement. Every such Shareholder shall thereby become a party to and be bound by the provisions of this Agreement with the same force and effect as if they had signed this Agreement. All such shares of the Company so transferred to the Voting Trustees may be from time to time registered in their names as such Voting Trustees or in the name of “Voting Trustees of Shares of [name of corporation] under Agreement dated the [number] day of [month and year].”2. Voting trust certificates. The Voting Trustees agree with the Shareholders and with each and every holder of certificates issued hereunder as hereinafter provided that from time to time upon request they will cause to be issued to the Shareholders or upon their order in respect of all shares so transferred to the Voting Trustees certificates in substantially the following form, hereinafter called the Voting Trust Certificates:No. [............................................] [ ............................................] Shares[name of corporation] Voting Trust CertificateThis is to certify that, as hereinafter provided, on the [number] day of [month and year], or upon the earlier or later termination of the agreement hereinafter mentioned, as provided in such agreement, on surrender of this certificate and upon payment, of the Voting Trustees shall so require, of the amount of any transfer tax or other charge in connection with such delivery [name of shareholder] will be entitled to receive a certificate or certificates, for common shares of [name of corporation], hereinafter called the Company, without nominal or par value (or if such shares shall be changed to shares with a par value then to a proportionate number of such shares with a par value) and in the meantime to receive payments equal to the cash dividends, if any, collected by the Voting Trustees under the agreement hereinafter mentioned, and in the case of dividends paid other than in cash to receive delivery in kind of a proportion of such dividends collected by the Voting Trustees, in respect of such like number of shares, provided that such dividends if received by the Voting Trustees in common shares of the Company shall be payable in trust certificates. Until the delivery of such share certificates the Voting Trustees shall possess, and be entitled in their discretion to exercise, all the rights and powers of every kind and character of absolute owners of such shares including, but without limitation, the right to receive dividends on such shares, to vote such shares in person or by proxy consent in writing or otherwise act with respect to any corporate or shareholders’ action, to increase or reduce the stated capital of the Company, to classify or reclassify any of the shares as now or hereafter authorized into preferred or common shares or other classes of shares with or without par value, to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, to merge or consolidate the Company with other corporations, to sell all or any part of its assets, to create any mortgage or security interest in or lien on its property or for any other corporate act or purpose; it being expressly stipulated that no voting right shall pass by or under this certificate or by or under any agreement, express or implied.This certificate is issued pursuant to, and the rights of the holders hereof are subject to all the terms and conditions of, a certain agreement dated the [number] day of [month and year], between the owners of common shares of the Company and the undersigned as Trustees, and [name of Bank or Trust Company], as Depositary.No share certificate shall be due or deliverable under such agreement before [date], except that if so authorized by the vote or consent in writing of holders of voting trust certificates representing a majority in amount of the outstanding common shares of the Company, the Voting Trustees may in their discretion from time to time postpone such date to a later date, in any event not later than the [number] day of [month and year], as provided in such agreement.This certificate is transferable at the office or agency of the Depositary for the time being under such agreement by the registered holder hereof, either in person or by attorney duly authorized, and on surrender hereof, according to such rules as the Voting Trustees may establish, and until so transferred the Voting Trustees and the Depositary may treat the registered holder as owner hereof for all purposes whatsoever.This certificate is not valid unless duly signed on behalf of the undersigned Voting Trustees and by the Depositary.In witness whereof the Voting Trustees have caused this certificate to be signed in their names by the Depositary, their duly authorized agent for that purpose.Dated [date] ____________________________________________________________________________________________Voting Trustees, By Their Agent,[Name of Depository]Depositary,by _______________________Assistant Secretary3. Transfers and record ownership. The Voting Trust Certificates shall be transferable at the office or agency of the Depositary by the registered holder thereof either in person or by attorney duly authorized and upon surrender thereof, according to such rules as the Voting Trustees may from time to time establish, and until so transferred the Voting Trustees and the Depositary may treat the registered holder as owner thereof for all purposes whatsoever. Every transferee of a Voting Trust Certificate hereunder shall by the acceptance thereof become a party to this Agreement with the same force and effect as if he had signed this Agreement, and shall be embraced within the meaning of the term Shareholder whenever used herein. Share certificates shall not be deliverable hereunder without the surrender of Voting Trust Certificates representing an equivalent number of shares. The transfer books of the Voting Trustees may, in their discretion, be closed and transfers of Voting Trust Certificates thereon may be suspended from time to time for such reasonable period as the Voting Trustees may determine. The Voting Trustees may, at any time, appoint a registrar for the Voting Trust Certificates, and may provide that Voting Trust Certificates shall not be valid unless registered and countersigned by such register.4. Surrender of certificates. On the [number] day of [month and year], or whenever earlier the Voting Trustees shall unanimously determine to authorize such delivery, the Voting Trustees, in exchange for and upon surrender of any Voting Trust Certificates then outstanding, will, in accordance with the terms hereof and on payment, if the Voting Trustees shall so require, of a sum sufficient to reimburse them for any transfer tax or other charge in connection with such delivery, deliver at the office of the Depositary share certificates of the Company to the amount called for by the respective Voting Trust Certificates so surrendered and may require the holders of Voting Trust Certificates to make such exchange; provided, however, that if so authorized by the vote or consent in writing of the holders of Voting Trust Certificates representing a majority in amount of the then outstanding common shares of the Company, the Voting Trustees may in their discretion from time to time postpone such date to a later date, in any event not later than the [number] day of [month and year]. Whenever share certificates of the Company shall become so deliverable, all further obligations of the Voting Trustees under this agreement, except to make such delivery, shall terminate.5. Dividends on shares. Prior to the time for delivery of share certificates of the Company in exchange for Voting Trust Certificates, the holder of each Voting Trust Certificate shall, in respect to the number of shares called for by such certificate, be entitled to receive from time to time payments equal to the cash dividends, if any, collected by the Voting Trustees upon a like number of shares of the Company standing in the name of the Voting Trustees; and in the case of dividends paid other than in cash such holder shall be entitled to receive from time to time delivery in kind of the proportion of such dividends collected by the Voting Trustees in respect of such like number of shares; provided, however, that if any such dividends shall be paid in fully paid common shares of the Company, the Voting Trustees shall hold, subject to the terms of this agreement, the certificates for such shares which shall be received by them on account of such dividend, and the holder of each Voting Trust Certificate shall be entitled to receive one or more additional Voting Trust Certificates issued under this agreement for shares in the amount received by the Voting Trustees, in payment of the dividend upon the number of shares called for by such Voting Trust Certificates.6. Subscriptions to new shares or securities. In case the Company shall offer any of its shares or other securities to its shareholders for subscription, then in such case upon receiving from the holder of any Voting Trust Certificate, prior to the time limited by the Company for subscription and payment, a written request to subscribe in their behalf, and the money required to pay for a stated amount of such shares or other securities (not in excess of the ratable amount subscribable in respect of the shares represented by such Voting Trust Certificate), the Voting Trustees will make such subscription and payment, and, upon receiving from the Company the share certificates or other securities so subscribed for, will, if common shares, issue one or more Voting Trust Certificates in respect thereof to the holder of the Voting Trust Certificate who shall have made such request and payment, and, if other shares or securities, will deliver such other shares or securities to the holders of Voting Trust Certificates who shall have made such request and payment. The Voting Trustees shall not, in any event, in respect of any dividend in shares or shares subscribed for, be required to deliver certificates representing fractional parts of a share, but may in lieu thereof deliver, in respect of fractional interests, fractional scrip certificates in such form and upon such terms and conditions as the Voting Trustees may in their discretion determine.7. Successor voting trustees. The Voting Trustees may appoint one or more additional voting trustees by a written instrument signed by them and deposited with the Depositary. Any Voting Trustee may at any time resign by delivering to the Depositary their resignation in writing, to take effect ten days thereafter, or upon its acceptance by the Voting Trustees. In every case of death, resignation, or inability of any Voting Trustee to act, the vacancy may be filled by the appointment of a successor to be made by a majority of the remaining Voting Trustees by a written instrument signed by them and deposited with the Depositary. The term “Voting Trustees” as used herein and in the Voting Trust Certificates shall apply to the Voting Trustees named herein and to any additional voting trustees appointed as hereinabove provided, and to their successors hereunder. Notwithstanding any vacancy among the Voting Trustees, the remaining Voting Trustees during the continuance of such vacancy shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights and perform all of the functions of the Voting Trustees. Notwithstanding any change in the Voting Trustees, the Voting Trustees for the time being may adopt and issue Voting Trust Certificates in the names of previous Voting Trustees.8. Successor depositary. The Depositary may at any time resign its duties, trust, and powers hereunder by giving ten days’ notice thereof to the Voting Trustees, and the Depositary may at any time be removed by written instrument signed by all of the then Voting Trustees and delivered to the Depositary. In case of a vacancy in the position of Depositary, a majority of the Voting Trustees then in office may designate as successor some other bank or trust company by an instrument in writing signed by them and delivered to such successor Depositary, which successor shall thereupon be entitled to all the rights, authorities, and powers hereby conferred on the above named Depositary. The Depositary so resigning or so removed shall thereupon transfer and deliver to such successor the share certificates then held by it hereunder, together with all books and records relating to such share certificates or to the Voting Trust Certificates.9. Action by voting trustees. The action of a majority of the Voting Trustees expressed from time to time at a meeting, or, by writing without a meeting, shall, except as otherwise herein stated, constitute the action of the Voting Trustees and shall have the same effect as if assented to by all. At any meeting of the Voting Trustees, any Voting Trustee may vote in person or by proxy given to any other Voting Trustee; and any Voting Trustee may give a power of attorney to any other Voting Trustee to sign for them in case of action of the Voting Trustees taken in writing without a meeting. The Voting Trustees may adopt their own rules of procedure. Any Voting Trustee may act as a director or officer of the Company, and they or any firm of which they may be a member, or any corporation of which they may be a shareholder, director, or officer, may purchase, sell, own, hold, or deal in Voting Trust Certificates, and may contract with the Company, or have a pecuniary interest in any transaction to which the Company may be a party, or in which it may in any way be interested, as fully as though they were not a Voting Trustee.10. Rights and powers of voting trustees. The Voting Trustees shall possess and be entitled, subject to the provisions hereof, in their discretion, to exercise all the rights and powers of absolute owners of all shares, deposited hereunder, including, but without limitation, the right to receive dividends on such shares and the right to vote, consent in writing, or otherwise act with respect to any corporate or shareholders’ action, to increase or reduce the stated capital of the Company, to classify or reclassify any of the shares as now or hereafter authorized into preferred or common shares or other classes of shares with or without par value, to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, to merge or consolidate the Company with other corporations, to sell all or any part of its assets, to create any mortgage or security interest in or lien on any property of the Company, or for any other corporate act or purpose; it being expressly stipulated that no voting right shall pass to others by or under the Voting Trust Certificates or by or under this agreement, or by or under any agreement express or implied.In case the Voting Trustees shall vote or otherwise act in respect of the shares deposited hereunder so as to effect a consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or of another corporation with or into the Company, the Voting Trustees may in connection with such consolidation or merger surrender such shares and receive in lieu thereof and exchange therefor the shares issuable therefor in such merger or consolidation, and may hold the shares so received in place of the shares deposited hereunder. Thereafter the rights and obligations of the Voting Trustees and of the holders of Voting Trust Certificates with respect to shares deposited hereunder shall for all purposes be treated as applying to the shares so received, there being substituted for each share of the Company an amount of the new shares proportionate to the entire amount of such new shares received for all of the shares of the Company so surrendered. Upon demand of the Voting Trustees to the holders of Voting Trust Certificates, such holders shall surrender their Voting Trust Certificates to the Depositary, as agent for the Voting Trustees, and shall accept in lieu thereof one or more new Voting Trust Certificates in form similar to that hereinbefore set forth, but modified so as to describe expressly the interest then represented by the Voting Trust Certificate. Any transfer tax or other charges payable in respect of any such exchange shall if so required by the Voting Trustees, be paid by the holders of the Voting Trust Certificates. The Voting Trustees are also authorized to become parties to or prosecute or defend or intervene in any suits or legal proceedings, and the shareholders and holders from time to time of the Voting Trust Certificates agree to hold the Voting Trustees harmless from any action or omission by them in the premises.11. Liability of voting trustees. In voting, or otherwise acting hereunder, with respect to shares deposited hereunder, the Voting Trustees will exercise their best judgment; but they assume no responsibility in respect to any action taken by them or their agents, and no Voting Trustee shall incur any responsibility by reason of any error of law or of anything done or suffered or omitted, except for their own individual willful misconduct. No voting Trustee shall be required to give any bond or other security for the discharge of their duties.12. Compensation of voting trustees. The Voting Trustees are not to receive any compensation for their services hereunder. The Voting Trustees may employ counsel, and such other assistance as may be convenient, in the performance of their functions. The Voting Trustees may receive from the Company reimbursement or indemnity for and against any and all claims, expenses, and liabilities incurred by them, or asserted against them, in connection with or growing out of this agreement or the discharge of their duties hereunder, including expenses incurred for the services of the Depositary hereunder. Any such claims, expenses, or liabilities not so paid may be charged to the holders of Voting Trust Certificates pro rata, and may be deducted from dividends or other distributions to them, or may be made a charge payable as a condition to the delivery of shares in exchange for Voting Trust Certificates as provided herein, and the Voting Trustees shall be entitled to a lien therefor upon the shares, funds, or other property in their possession or that of the Depositary hereunder.13. Meetings of certificate holders. In the event that the Voting Trustees shall desire to ascertain the views of the holders of record of the Voting Trust Certificates issued hereunder with respect to any action or thing done or proposed to be done by them or by the Company, or upon any other question, the Voting Trustees may for such purpose call a meeting of such certificate holders to be held at the principal office of the Company in the State of New York or at any place in [city], New York that the Voting Trustees may select. Such call shall set forth the time, place, and purpose of the meeting and notice thereof shall be mailed at least [number, e.g., ten] days before the date of such meeting to each holder of record of Voting Trust Certificates outstanding hereunder who shall not waive such notice. At such meeting every holder of record of Voting Trust Certificates outstanding hereunder shall have one vote for each common share represented by Voting Trust Certificates standing in their name and may vote in person or by proxy. If at any such meeting the holders of record of Voting Trust Certificates representing two-thirds in amount of the shares held hereunder shall affirmatively concur in any expression or view with regard to any matter or thing mentioned in the call of such meeting, such expression may conclusively and for all purposes be deemed by the Voting Trustees to be that of all holders of Voting Trust Certificates outstanding hereunder. Each and every holder of record of Voting Trust Certificates outstanding hereunder agrees for themselves, their successors, and assigns to accept and be bound by such determination of the holders of Voting Trust Certificates representing two-thirds in amount of the securities held hereunder as herein provided. No action at any such meeting shall operate to modify the express provisions of this agreement or in any way limit the powers and discretion of the Voting Trustees as defined by this agreement.14. Surrender of shares for cancellation. The Voting Trustees may at any time in their discretion and to such extent as they may deem advisable deliver, in exchange for Voting Trust Certificates, certificates for shares of the Company in an amount equal to the shares represented by such Voting Trust Certificates in order to enable the surrender to the Company for cancellation of the shares so delivered, or otherwise as the Voting Trustees may in their absolute discretion deem advisable, and the delivery of any such shares of the Company to any one or more holders of Voting Trust Certificates shall not entitle such holder or holders or any other holder or holders of Voting Trust Certificates to demand delivery of all or any part of the shares of the Company remaining deposited hereunder.15. Voting trustees as shareholders. The Voting Trustees herein appointed, and their successors, may be parties to this agreement as Shareholders, and to the extent of the shares deposited by them they shall be entitled in all respects to the same rights and benefits as other Shareholders.16.

Liability of Depositary. The Depositary assumes no responsibility for the acts of the Voting Trustees. The Depositary shall not be required to defend any suit, take any action, or incur any expense or liability hereunder unless requested in writing by the holders of a majority in amount of the Voting Trust Certificates or a majority of the Voting Trustees and indemnified to its satisfaction. The Depositary shall be fully protected in all cases in acting upon the written directions or with the written approval of a majority of the Voting Trustees, except as otherwise herein expressly provided, and shall in no case be liable for any act or omission except only for its own willful misconduct.19. The Voting Trustees shall keep at [location, e.g., their office] correct books and records of account of all their business and transactions pertaining to the Agreement, and a record of certificate holders containing the names, alphabetically arranged, of all persons who are Voting Trust Certificate holders, showing their places of residence, the number and class of shares represented by the certificates held by them respectively, and the date when they respectively became the owners thereof. Upon at least [number, e.g., five] days’ written demand, a copy of this Voting Trust Agreement and a record of certificate holders shall be open during the usual business hours for inspection by any person who is a holder of a voting trust certificate or by their attorney, provided such inspection shall not be for a purpose for which inspection may be denied by Section 624(c) of the Business Corporation Law.20. Execution of this agreement. This agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be an original, and such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. One of such counterparts shall be kept at the office of the Depositary and one at the office of the Secretary of the Company, each of which shall be available to inspection by any holder of a Voting Trust Certificate.21. Term of Agreement; Extensions. This Agreement shall become effective upon the date hereof and continue in effect for a period of ten (10) years from such date subject, however, to the prior termination of this Agreement by the execution and filing with the Company of an agreement of termination executed by all of the registered holders of Voting Trust Certificates then outstanding and subject to this Agreement. This Agreement may be extended for additional periods not exceeding ten (10) years at any time within six months before its termination by an agreement in writing by one or more of the holders of the Voting Trust Certificates.22.

Any action or proceeding relating to, enforcing, or interpreting this Agreement shall be brought and maintained exclusively in any proper forum in [county name] County, New York. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR ACTION ARISING FROM THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.23. Waiver. No waiver of any term or right in this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party or parties. The failure of any party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or modification of such provision, or impairment of its right to enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement thereafter.24. Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed as if said unenforceable or invalid provision had not been contained herein.25. Entire Agreement; Modifications. This Agreement expresses the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all negotiations, prior discussions, preliminary agreements, letters of intent and previous agreements, whether written, oral, electronic or otherwise, relating to the subject matter hereunder.

Each transferee of a Class [A] Note, Class [B] Note, Class [C] Note, or Class [D] Note that is a Book Entry Note that is a Benefit Plan Entity shall be deemed to represent that its acquisition and holding of the Book Entry Note is covered by a Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption or the Statutory Exemption (or, if it is subject to any Similar Law, such acquisition and holding will not violate such Similar Law).Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any sale or other transfer of a Class E Note that is a Definitive Note, the transferee of such Definitive Note shall be required to represent and warrant in writing to the Note Registrar that (i) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of or investing the assets of, (a) an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA, (b) a "plan" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code) that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or (c) an entity whose underlying assets are deemed to be assets of an employee benefit plan or a plan described in (a) or (b) by reason of such employee benefit plan's or plan's investment in the entity (collectively a "Benefit Plan Investor") and (ii) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of or investing the assets of, an employee benefit plan or similar arrangement that is not a Benefit Plan Investor unless such transferee's acquisition and holding of the Class E Note will not constitute or result in a non-exempt violation of any provision of Similar Law. Each transferee of a Class E Note that is a Book Entry Note shall be deemed to represent that it is not a Benefit Plan Entity.No service charge shall be made to a Noteholder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Note Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.3. or 9.6. not involving any transfer.The preceding provisions of this section notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to make and the Note Registrar shall not register transfers or exchanges of Notes selected for redemption or of any Note for a period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment with respect to the Note.Section 2.5.

The Trustee shall also adopt and employ, at the expense of the Issuer, any other reasonable means of notification of such repayment (including, but not limited to, mailing notice of such repayment to Holders whose Notes have been called but have not been surrendered for redemption or whose right to or interest in moneys due and payable but not claimed is determinable from the records of the Trustee or of any Note Paying Agent, at the last address of record for each such Holder).Section 3.4.

full right, power and authority to take, or defer from taking, any and all acts with respect to the administration, maintenance or disposition of the Trust Estate.(c) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion, as more particularly provided in Section 5.4., and shall, at the direction of the [Majority Noteholders], proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Noteholders by such appropriate Proceedings as the Trustee or the Trustee at the direction of such [Majority Noteholders] shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture (including, without limitation, Sections 5.4.(a), 5.12., 5.13. and 5.17.), if the Issuer fails to perform its obligations under Section 10.1.(b) hereof when and as due, the Trustee shall, at the written direction of the [Majority Noteholders], proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Noteholders by such appropriate Proceedings as the Trustee or the [Majority Noteholders], shall deem most effective to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for specific performance of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.(e) In case there shall be pending, relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Notes or any Person having or claiming an ownership interest in the Trust Estate, proceedings under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor or Person, or in case of any other comparable Proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of any Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:(1) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except as a result of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct) and of the Noteholders allowed in such Proceedings;(2) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the Noteholders in any election of a trustee, a standby trustee or person performing similar functions in any such Proceedings;(3) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Noteholders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and(4) to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee or the Noteholders allowed in any Proceedings relative to the Issuer, its creditors and its property;and any trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official in any such Proceeding is hereby authorized by each of such Noteholders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to such Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as a result of negligence or bad faith.(f) Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such Proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person.(g) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or Proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes.(h) In any Proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any Proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture), the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such proceedings.Section 5.4. Remedies. (a) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may, or at the direction of the [Majority Noteholders] shall, do one or more of the following (subject to Section 5.5.):(1) institute Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of all amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect from the Issuer and any other obligor upon such moneys adjudged due;(2) institute Proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture with respect to the Trust Estate;(3) exercise any remedies of a secured party under the UCC and take any other appropriate action to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes; and(4) direct the Trust Collateral Agent to sell the Trust Estate or any portion thereof or rights or interest therein, at one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any manner permitted by law; provided, however, that, the Trustee may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Trust Estate following an Event of Default unless:(i) such Event of Default is of the type described in Section5.1.(a) or (b), or(ii) either(A) the Holders of [100]% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes consent thereto, or(B) the proceeds of such sale or liquidation distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to discharge in full all amounts then due and unpaid upon such Notes for principal and interest, or(C) the Trustee determines that the Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes as they would have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and payable, and the Trustee provides prior written notice to the Issuer (who shall deliver such notice to the Rating Agencies) and obtains the consent of Holders of [66-2/3]% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes.In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (y) and (z), the Trustee may, but need not, obtain and conclusively rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such purpose.Section 5.5. Optional Preservation of the Receivables. If the Notes have been declared to be due and payable under Section 5.2. following an Event of Default and such declaration and its consequences have not been rescinded and annulled, the Trustee may, but need not, elect to direct the Trust Collateral Agent to maintain possession of the Trust Estate. It is the desire of the parties hereto and the Noteholders that there be at all times sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes, and the Trustee shall take such desire into account when determining whether or not to direct the Trust Collateral Agent to maintain possession of the Trust Estate. In determining whether to direct the Trust Collateral Agent to maintain possession of the Trust Estate, the Trustee may, but need not, obtain and conclusively rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such purpose.Section 5.6. Priorities. (a) Following (1) the acceleration of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.2. or (2) the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to Sections 5.1.(a), 5.1.(b), 5.1.(d), 5.1.(e) or 5.1.(f) of this Indenture or (3) the receipt of Insolvency Proceeds pursuant to Section [10.1(b)] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Available Funds, plus any amounts on deposit in the Reserve Account, including any money or property collected pursuant to Section 5.4. of this Indenture and any such Insolvency Proceeds, shall be applied by the Trust Collateral Agent on the related Distribution Date in the following order of priority:FIRST: amounts due and owing and required to be distributed to the Servicer (provided there is no Servicer Termination Event), the Lockbox Bank, the Lockbox Processor, the Owner Trustee, the Trustee and the Trust Collateral Agent, respectively, pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of Section [5.7(a)] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement and not previously distributed, ratably and without preference or priority of any kind without regard to any caps set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section [5.7(a)] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement;SECOND: to the Class [A] Noteholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [A] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium), ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [A] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium);THIRD: to Holders of the Class [A] Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [A] Notes in respect of principal, first, to the Holders of the Class [A-1] Notes, until the Outstanding Amount of the Class [A-1] Notes is reduced to zero, and second, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable to the Holders of the Class [A-2] Notes and the Class [A-3] Notes, until the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Class [A-2] Notes and the Class [A-3] Notes is reduced to zero;FOURTH: to the Class [B] Noteholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [B] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium), according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [B] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium);FIFTH: to Holders of the Class [B] Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [B] Notes in respect of principal, according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [B] Notes in respect of principal, until the Outstanding Amount of the Class [B] Notes is reduced to zero;SIXTH: to the Class [C] Noteholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [C] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium), according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [C] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium); SEVENTH: to Holders of the Class [C] Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [C] Notes in respect of principal, according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [C] Notes in respect of principal, until the Outstanding Amount of the Class [C] Notes is reduced to zero;EIGHTH: to the Class [D] Noteholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [D] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium), according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [D] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium);NINTH: to Holders of the Class [D] Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [D] Notes in respect of principal, according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [D] Notes in respect of principal, until the Outstanding Amount of the Class [D] Notes is reduced to zero;TENTH: to the Class [E] Noteholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [E] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium), according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [E] Notes in respect of interest (including any premium);ELEVENTH: to Holders of the Class [E] Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Class [E] Notes in respect of principal, according to the amounts due and payable on the Class [E] Notes in respect of principal, until the Outstanding Amount of the Class [E] Notes is reduced to zero;TWELFTH: to the Certificateholder.(b) The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders pursuant to this Section 5.6.. At least [15] days before such record date the Issuer shall mail to each Noteholder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and the amount to be paid.Section 5.7. Limitation of Suits. No Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:(a) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;(b) the Holders of not less than [25]% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes have made written request to the Trustee to institute such Proceeding in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;(c) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in complying with such request;(d) the Trustee for [60] days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute such Proceedings; and (e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the [Majority Noteholders].Section 5.8. Unconditional Rights of Noteholders to Receive Principal and Interest. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Indenture, the Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on such Note on or after the respective due dates thereof expressed in such Note or in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.Section 5.9. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Controlling Party or any Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Noteholder, then and in every such case the Issuer, the Trustee and the Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such Proceeding had been instituted.Section 5.10. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Controlling Party or to the Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.Section 5.11. Delay or Omission Not a Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee, the Controlling Party or any Holder of any Note to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article V. or by law to the Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Noteholders, as the case may be.Section 5.12. Control by Noteholders. The [Majority Noteholders] shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy available to the Trust Collateral Agent, as Controlling Party, or the Trustee, as applicable, with respect to the Notes or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Controlling Party or the Trustee, as applicable; provided that(a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture;(b) subject to the express terms of Section 5.4., any direction to the Trustee to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall be by the Noteholders representing not less than [100]% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes;(c) if the conditions set forth in Section 5.5. have been satisfied and the Trustee elects to retain the Trust Estate pursuant to such Section, then any direction to the Trustee by Noteholders representing less than [100]% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate shall be of no force and effect; and(d) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction;provided, however, that, subject to Article VI., the Trustee need not take any action that it determines might involve it in liability, financial or otherwise, without receiving indemnity satisfactory to it, or might materially adversely affect the rights of any Noteholders not consenting to such action.Section 5.13. Waiver of Past Defaults. Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes as provided in Section 5.4., the [Majority Noteholders] may waive any past Default or Event of Default and its consequences except a Default (a) in payment of principal of or interest on any of the Notes or (b) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Note. In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.Section 5.14. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Note by such Holder's acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to (a) any suit instituted by the Trustee, (b) any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, in each case holding in the aggregate more than [10]% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes or (c) any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of principal of or interest on any Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note and in this Indenture (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).Section 5.15. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Issuer covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead or in any manner whatsoever, claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.Section 5.16. Action on Notes. The Trustee's right to seek and recover judgment on the Notes or under this Indenture shall not be affected by the seeking, obtaining or application of any other relief under or with respect to this Indenture. Neither the lien of this Indenture nor any rights or remedies of the Trustee or the Noteholders shall be impaired by the recovery of any judgment by the Trustee against the Issuer or by the levy of any execution under such judgment upon any portion of the Trust Estate or upon any of the assets of the Issuer.Section 5.17. Performance and Enforcement of Certain Obligations. (a) Promptly following a request from the Trustee to do so and at the Servicer's expense, the Issuer agrees to take all such lawful action as the Trustee may request to compel or secure the performance and observance by the Seller and the Servicer, as applicable, of each of their obligations to the Issuer under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, and to exercise any and all rights, remedies, powers and privileges lawfully available to the Issuer under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement to the extent and in the manner directed by the Trustee, including the transmission of notices of default on the part of the Seller or the Servicer thereunder and the institution of legal or administrative actions or Proceedings to compel or secure performance by the Seller or the Servicer of each of their obligations under the Sale and Servicing Agreement.(b) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Controlling Party may, and, at the written direction of the Holders of [66-2/3]% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes shall, subject to Article VI., exercise all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and claims of the Issuer against the Seller or the Servicer under or in connection with the Sale and Servicing Agreement, including the right or power to take any action to compel or secure performance or observance by the Seller or the Servicer of each of their obligations to the Issuer thereunder and to give any consent, request, notice, direction, approval, extension or waiver under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and any right of the Issuer to take such action shall be suspended.ARTICLE VI. THE TRUSTEE AND THE TRUST COLLATERAL AGENT. Section 6.1. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and the Basic Documents to which it is a party and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:(1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and(2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; however, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform on their face to the requirements of this Indenture.(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:(1) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section;(2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 5.12..(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuer.(e) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law or the terms of this Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement.(f) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against such risk or liability is not assured to it.(g) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 6.1. and to the provisions of the TIA.(h) The Trustee shall, and hereby agrees that it will, perform all of the obligations and duties required of it under the Sale and Servicing Agreement.(i) Without limiting the generality of this Section 6.1., the Trustee shall have no duty (i) to see to any recording, filing or depositing of this Indenture or any agreement referred to herein or any financing statement evidencing a security interest in the Financed Vehicles, or to see to the maintenance of any such recording or filing or depositing or to any recording, refiling or redepositing of any thereof, (ii) to see to any insurance of the Financed Vehicles or Obligors or to effect or maintain any such insurance, (iii) to see to the payment or discharge of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge or any Lien or encumbrance of any kind owing with respect to, assessed or levied against any part of the Trust, (iv) to confirm or verify the contents of any reports or certificates delivered to the Trustee pursuant to this Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement believed by the Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties, or (v) to inspect the Financed Vehicles at any time or ascertain or inquire as to the performance of observance of any of the Issuer's, the Seller's or the Servicer's representations, warranties or covenants or the Servicer's duties and obligations as Servicer and as custodian of the Receivable Files under the Sale and Servicing Agreement.(j) In no event shall [(name of Trustee/Trust Collateral Agent)], in any of its capacities hereunder, be deemed to have assumed any duties of the Owner Trustee under the Delaware Statutory Trust Statute, common law, or the Trust Agreement.Section 6.2. Rights of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.(b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officer's Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officer's Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.(c) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys or a custodian or nominee, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of, or for the supervision of, [(name of Servicer)], or any other such agent, attorney, custodian or nominee appointed with due care by it hereunder.(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith.(e) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Notes shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.(f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to institute, conduct or defend any litigation under this Indenture or in relation to this Indenture, at the request, order or direction of any of the Noteholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Noteholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that may be incurred therein or thereby; provided, however, that the Trustee shall, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (that has not been cured), exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture with reasonable care and skill.(g) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by the Noteholders evidencing not less than [25]% of the Outstanding Amount thereof; provided, however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture or the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such cost, expense or liability as a condition to so proceeding; the reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid by the Person making such request, or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be reimbursed by the Person making such request upon demand.(h) The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses on investments except for losses resulting from the failure of the Trustee to make an investment in accordance with instructions given in accordance hereunder. If the Trustee acts as the Note Paying Agent or Note Registrar, the rights and protections afforded to the Trustee shall be afforded to the Note Paying Agent and Note Registrar.Section 6.3. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Note Paying Agent, Note Registrar, co-registrar or co-Note Paying Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 6.11. and 6.12..Section 6.4. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture, the Trust Estate or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Issuer's use of the proceeds from the Notes, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Issuer in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Notes or in the Notes other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication.Section 6.5. Notice of Defaults. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is either known by, or written notice of the existence thereof has been delivered to, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder notice of the Default within [90] days after such knowledge or notice occurs. Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Note (including payments pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions of such Note), the Trustee may withhold the notice to the Noteholder if and so long as it in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Noteholders.Section 6.6. Reports by Trustee to Holders. At the end of each calendar year, the Trustee shall deliver to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a Noteholder a statement as to the aggregate amounts of interest and principal paid to the Noteholder to the extent required by the Code and any other information as may be reasonably required to enable such Holder to prepare its federal and state income tax returns.Section 6.7. Compensation and Indemnity. (a) Pursuant to Section 5.7(a) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall, or shall cause the Servicer to, pay to the Trustee and the Trust Collateral Agent (subject to any applicable caps) from time to time compensation for its services. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Issuer shall cause the Servicer to reimburse the Trustee and the Trust Collateral Agent (subject to any applicable caps) for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's and the Trust Collateral Agent's agents, counsel, accountants and experts. The Issuer shall cause the Servicer to indemnify the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents against any and all loss, liability or expense (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by each of them in connection with the acceptance or the administration of this Trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent shall notify the Issuer and the Servicer promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent to so notify the Issuer and the Servicer shall not relieve the Issuer of its obligations hereunder or the Servicer of its obligations under Article [XI] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. The Issuer shall cause the Servicer to defend the claim, and the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent may have separate counsel and the Issuer shall cause the Servicer to pay the fees and expenses of such counsel. Neither the Issuer nor the Servicer need to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent through the Trustee's or the Trust Collateral Agent's own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith.(b) The Issuer's payment obligations to the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section shall survive the discharge of this Indenture or the earlier resignation or removal of the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent. When the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 5.1.(d) or (e) with respect to the Issuer, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Indenture or the Basic Documents, the Trustee agrees that the obligations of the Issuer (but not the Servicer) to the Trustee hereunder and under the Basic Documents shall be recourse to the Trust Estate only and specifically shall not be recourse to the assets of the Certificateholder or any Noteholder.

Performance of Duties. The Trust Collateral Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Indenture and the other Basic Documents to which the Trust Collateral Agent is a party or as directed by the Controlling Party in accordance with this Indenture.

Notwithstanding any term or provision of this Indenture, the Trust Collateral Agent shall incur no liability to the Issuer or the Issuer Secured Parties for any action taken or omitted by the Trust Collateral Agent in connection with the Collateral, except for the negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Trust Collateral Agent, and, further, shall incur no liability to the Issuer Secured Parties except for negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in carrying out its duties to the Issuer Secured Parties. The Trust Collateral Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability to any such party in relying upon the accuracy, acting in reliance upon the contents, and assuming the genuineness of any notice, demand, certificate, signature, instrument or other document reasonably believed by the Trust Collateral Agent to be genuine and to have been duly executed by the appropriate signatory, and (absent actual knowledge to the contrary by a Responsible Officer of the Trust Collateral Agent) the Trust Collateral Agent shall not be required to make any independent investigation with respect thereto. The Trust Collateral Agent shall at all times be free independently to establish to its reasonable satisfaction, but shall have no duty to independently verify, the existence or nonexistence of facts that are a condition to the exercise or enforcement of any right or remedy hereunder or under any of the Basic Documents. The Trust Collateral Agent may consult with counsel, and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The Trust Collateral Agent shall not be under any obligation to exercise any of the remedial rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture or to follow any direction from the Trustee or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder unless it shall have received reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trust Collateral Agent against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it.Section 6.16. Reliance Upon Documents. In the absence of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, the Trust Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any communication, instrument, paper or other document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons and shall have no liability in acting, or omitting to act, where such action or omission to act is in reasonable reliance upon any statement or opinion contained in any such document or instrument.Section 6.17. Successor Trust Collateral Agent. (a) Merger. Any Person into which the Trust Collateral Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer its trust business and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole, or any Person resulting from any such conversion, merger, consolidation, sale or transfer to which the Trust Collateral Agent is a party, shall (provided it is otherwise qualified to serve as the Trust Collateral Agent hereunder) be and become a successor Trust Collateral Agent hereunder and be vested with all of the title to and interest in the Collateral and all of the trusts, powers, discretions, immunities, privileges and other matters as was its predecessor without the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act, deed or conveyance on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, except to the extent, if any, that any such action is necessary to perfect, or continue the perfection of, the security interest of the Issuer Secured Parties in the Collateral; provided that any such successor shall also be the successor Trustee under Section 6.9..(b) Resignation. The Trust Collateral Agent and any successor Trust Collateral Agent may resign at any time by so notifying the Issuer; provided that the Trust Collateral Agent shall not so resign unless it shall also resign as Trustee hereunder.(c) Removal. The Trust Collateral Agent may be removed by the Trustee at any time (and should be removed at any time that the Trustee has been removed), with or without cause, by an instrument or concurrent instruments in writing delivered to the Trust Collateral Agent, the other Issuer Secured Party and the Issuer. A temporary successor may be removed at any time to allow a successor Trust Collateral Agent to be appointed pursuant to subsection (d) below. Any removal pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (c) shall take effect only upon the date which is the latest of (i) the effective date of the appointment of a successor Trust Collateral Agent and the acceptance in writing by such successor Trust Collateral Agent of such appointment and of its obligation to perform its duties hereunder in accordance with the provisions hereof, and (ii) receipt by the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect described in Section 3.6..(d) Acceptance by Successor. The Trustee shall have the sole right to appoint each successor Trust Collateral Agent. Every temporary or permanent successor Trust Collateral Agent appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to its predecessor and to the Trustee, each Issuer Secured Party and the Issuer an instrument in writing accepting such appointment hereunder and the relevant predecessor shall execute, acknowledge and deliver such other documents and instruments as will effectuate the delivery of all Collateral to the successor Trust Collateral Agent, whereupon such successor, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor. Such predecessor shall, nevertheless, on the written request of either Issuer Secured Party or the Issuer, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all the estates, properties, rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder. In the event that any instrument in writing from the Issuer or an Issuer Secured Party is reasonably required by a successor Trust Collateral Agent to more fully and certainly vest in such successor the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and obligations vested or intended to be vested hereunder in the Trust Collateral Agent, any and all such written instruments shall, at the request of the temporary or permanent successor Trust Collateral Agent, be forthwith executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Trustee or the Issuer, as the case may be. The designation of any successor Trust Collateral Agent and the instrument or instruments removing any Trust Collateral Agent and appointing a successor hereunder, together with all other instruments provided for herein, shall be maintained with the records relating to the Collateral and, to the extent required by applicable law, filed or recorded by the successor Trust Collateral Agent in each place where such filing or recording is necessary to effect the transfer of the Collateral to the successor Trust Collateral Agent or to protect or continue the perfection of the security interests granted hereunder.Section 6.18.

Such representations and warranties speak as of the execution and delivery of this Indenture and as of the Closing Date, but shall survive the pledge of the Receivables to the Trust Collateral Agent and shall not be waived.Section 6.20. Waiver of Setoffs. The Trust Collateral Agent hereby expressly waives any and all rights of setoff that the Trust Collateral Agent may otherwise at any time have under applicable law with respect to any Trust Account and agrees that amounts in the Trust Accounts shall at all times be held and applied solely in accordance with the provisions hereof and the Sale and Servicing Agreement.ARTICLE VII.

Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Noteholders. The Issuer and the Trustee, when authorized by an Issuer Order, also may, with prior notice to the Rating Agencies by the Issuer, and with the consent of the [Majority Noteholders], by Act of such Holders delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to, or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of, this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Notes under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby:(a) change the date of payment of any installment of principal of or interest on any Note, or reduce the principal amount thereof, the interest rate thereon or the Redemption Price with respect thereto, change the provision of this Indenture relating to the application of collections on, or the proceeds of the sale of, the Trust Estate to payment of principal of or interest on the Notes, or change any place of payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Note or the interest thereon is payable;(b) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of the provisions of this Indenture requiring the application of funds available therefor, as provided in Article V., to the payment of any such amount due on the Notes on or after the respective due dates thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date);(c) reduce the percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of the Holders of which is required for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences provided for in this Indenture;(d) modify or alter the provisions of the proviso to the definition of the term "Outstanding" or the term "Majority Noteholders";(e) reduce the percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes required to direct the Trustee to direct the Issuer to sell or liquidate the Trust Estate pursuant to Section 5.4.;(f) modify any provision of this Section except to increase any percentage specified herein or to provide that certain additional provisions of this Indenture or the Basic Documents cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Note affected thereby;(g) modify any of the provisions of this Indenture in such manner as to affect the calculation of the amount of any payment of interest or principal due on any Note on any Distribution Date (including the calculation of any of the individual components of such calculation) or to affect the rights of the Noteholders to the benefit of any provisions for the mandatory redemption of the Notes contained herein; or(h) permit the creation of any lien ranking prior to or on a parity with the lien of this Indenture with respect to any part of the Trust Estate or, except as otherwise permitted or contemplated herein or in any of the Basic Documents, terminate the lien of this Indenture on any property at any time subject hereto or deprive the Holder of any Note of the security provided by the lien of this Indenture.The Trustee may determine whether or not any Notes would be affected by any supplemental indenture and any such determination shall be conclusive upon the Holders of all Notes, whether theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder. The Trustee shall not be liable for any such determination made in good faith.It shall not be necessary for any Act of Noteholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.Promptly after the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders of the Notes to which such amendment or supplemental indenture relates a notice setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Trustee to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.Section 9.3. Execution of Supplemental Indentures. In executing, or permitting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article IX. or the amendments or modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.Section 9.4. Effect of Supplemental Indenture. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith with respect to the Notes affected thereby, and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties, liabilities and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Notes shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.Section 9.5. Conformity with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment of this Indenture and every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article IX. shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect so long as this Indenture shall then be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.Section 9.6. Reference in Notes to Supplemental Indentures. Notes authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article IX. may, and if required by the Trustee shall, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Issuer or the Trustee shall so determine, new Notes so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Issuer, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Notes.ARTICLE X. REDEMPTION OF NOTES. Section 10.1. Redemption. (a) The Notes shall be redeemed in whole, but not in part, on any Distribution Date on which the Servicer or Seller exercises its option to purchase the Trust Estate pursuant to Section [10.1(a)] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, for a purchase price equal to the Redemption Price; provided, however, that no such redemption may be effected unless the Issuer has available funds sufficient to pay the Redemption Price on such Distribution Date. The Servicer or the Issuer shall furnish the Rating Agencies notice of such redemption. If the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to this Section [10.1(a)], the Servicer or the Issuer shall furnish notice of such election to the Trustee not later than 25 days prior to the Redemption Date and the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee in the Collection Account the amount required to be so deposited pursuant to Section [10.1(a)] of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, whereupon all outstanding Notes shall be due and payable on the Redemption Date subject to the furnishing of a notice complying with Section 10.2. to each Holder of Notes.(b) In the event that the assets of the Trust are distributed pursuant to Section 8.1. of the Trust Agreement, all amounts on deposit in the Note Distribution Account shall be paid to the Noteholders up to the Outstanding Amount of the Notes and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. If amounts are to be paid to Noteholders pursuant to this Section 10.1.(b), the Servicer or the Issuer shall, to the extent practicable, furnish notice of such event to the Trustee not later than [45] days prior to the Redemption Date whereupon all such amounts shall be payable on the Redemption Date.Section 10.2. Form of Redemption. (a) Notice of redemption under Section 10.1.(a) shall be given by the Trustee by facsimile or by first-class mail, postage prepaid, transmitted or mailed prior to the applicable Redemption Date to each Holder of Notes, as of the close of business on the Record Date preceding the applicable Redemption Date, at such Holder's address appearing in the Note Register.All notices of redemption shall state:(1) the Redemption Date;(2) the Redemption Price;(3) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to such Redemption Date is not applicable and that payments shall be made only upon presentation and surrender of such Notes and the place where such Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price (which shall be the office or agency of the Issuer to be maintained as provided in Section 3.2.); and(4) that interest on the Notes shall cease to accrue on the Redemption Date.(b) Notice of redemption of the Notes shall be given by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer. Failure to give notice of redemption, or any defect therein, to any Holder of any Note shall not impair or affect the validity of the redemption of any other Note.(c) Prior notice of redemption under Section 10.1.(b) is not required to be given to the Noteholders.Section 10.3. Notes Payable on Redemption Date. The Notes to be redeemed shall, following notice of redemption, as required by Section 10.2. (in the case of redemption pursuant to Section 10.1.(a)), on the Redemption Date become due and payable at the Redemption Price and (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price) no interest shall accrue on the Redemption Price for any period after the date to which accrued interest is calculated for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.ARTICLE XI. MISCELLANEOUS. Section 11.1. Compliance Certificates and Opinions, etc. (a) Upon any application or request by the Issuer to the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent to take any action under any provision of this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent, as the case may be, (1) an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with, (2) an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent, if any, have been complied with and (3) (if required by the TIA) an Independent Certificate from a firm of certified public accountants meeting the applicable requirements of this Section, except that, in the case of any such application or request as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include:(1) a statement that each signatory of such certificate or opinion has read or has caused to be read such covenant or condition and the definitions herein relating thereto;(2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based;(3) a statement that, in the opinion of each such signatory, such signatory has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable such signatory to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and(4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such signatory such condition or covenant has been complied with.(b)(1) Prior to the deposit of any Collateral or other property or securities with the Trust Collateral Agent that is to be made the basis for the release of any property or securities subject to the lien of this Indenture, the Issuer shall, in addition to any obligation imposed in Section 11.1.(a) or elsewhere in this Indenture, furnish to the Trust Collateral Agent an Officer's Certificate certifying or stating the opinion of each person signing such certificate as to the fair value (within 90 days of such deposit) to the Issuer of the Collateral or other property or securities to be so deposited.(2) Whenever the Issuer is required to furnish to the Trust Collateral Agent an Officer's Certificate certifying or stating the opinion of any signer thereof as to the matters described in clause (1) above, the Issuer shall also deliver to the Trust Collateral Agent an Independent Certificate as to the same matters, if the fair value to the Issuer of the securities to be so deposited and of all other such securities made the basis of any such withdrawal or release since the commencement of the then-current fiscal year of the Issuer, as set forth in the certificates delivered pursuant to clause (1) above and this clause (2), is [10]% or more of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, but such a certificate need not be furnished with respect to any securities so deposited, if the fair value thereof to the Issuer as set forth in the related Officer's Certificate is less than $[25,000] or less than [1]% percent of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes.(3) Other than with respect to the release of any Purchased Receivables, Sold Receivables or Liquidated Receivables, whenever any property or securities are to be released from the lien of this Indenture, the Issuer shall also furnish to the Trust Collateral Agent an Officer's Certificate certifying or stating the opinion of each person signing such certificate as to the fair value (within 90 days of such release) of the property or securities proposed to be released and stating that in the opinion of such person the proposed release will not impair the security under this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof.(4) Whenever the Issuer is required to furnish to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate certifying or stating the opinion of any signer thereof as to the matters described in clause (3) above, the Issuer shall also furnish to the Trust Collateral Agent an Independent Certificate as to the same matters if the fair value of the property or securities and of all other property other than Purchased Receivables, Sold Receivables and Defaulted Receivables, or securities released from the lien of this Indenture since the commencement of the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates required by clause (3) above and this clause (4), equals [10]% or more of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, but such certificate need not be furnished in the case of any release of property or securities if the fair value thereof as set forth in the related Officer's Certificate is less than $[25,000] or less than [1] percent of the then Outstanding Amount of the Notes.(5) Notwithstanding Section 2.9. or any other provision of this Section, the Issuer may (A) collect, liquidate, sell or otherwise dispose of Receivables as and to the extent permitted or required by the Basic Documents and (B) make cash payments out of the Trust Accounts as and to the extent permitted or required by the Basic Documents.Section 11.2. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee. In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which their certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate of an Authorized Officer or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Servicer, the Seller or the Issuer, stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Servicer, the Seller or the Issuer, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.Whenever in this Indenture, in connection with any application or certificate or report to the Trustee, it is provided that the Issuer shall deliver any document as a condition of the granting of such application, or as evidence of the Issuer's compliance with any term hereof, it is intended that the truth and accuracy, at the time of the granting of such application or at the effective date of such certificate or report (as the case may be), of the facts and opinions stated in such document shall in such case be conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to have such application granted or to the sufficiency of such certificate or report. The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to affect the Trustee's right to rely upon the truth and accuracy of any statement or opinion contained in any such document as provided in Article VI..Section 11.3. Acts of Noteholders. (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Noteholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Noteholders in person or by agents duly appointed in writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly provided such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Noteholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section6.1.) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Section. In the event the Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or more groups of Noteholders, each representing less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes or the [Majority Noteholders], the Trustee in its sole discretion may determine what action, if any, shall be taken, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture.(b) The fact and date of the execution by any person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any customary manner of the Trustee.(c) The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register.(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Notes shall bind the Holder of every Note issued upon the registration thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Note.Section 11.4. Notices, etc., to Trustee, Issuer and Rating Agencies. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Noteholders or other documents provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to or filed with:(a) The Trustee by any Noteholder or by the Issuer shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if personally delivered, delivered by overnight courier or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or(b) The Issuer by the Trustee or by any Noteholder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if personally delivered, delivered by overnight courier or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested and shall deemed to have been duly given upon receipt to the Issuer addressed to: [(name and address of trust)], or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by Issuer. The Issuer shall promptly transmit any notice received by it from the Noteholders to the Trustee.(c) Notices required to be given to the Rating Agencies shall be provided by the Issuer in writing, personally delivered, electronically delivered, delivered by overnight courier or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested to [(name and address of applicable Rating Agencies)]; or as to each of the foregoing, at such other address as shall be designated by written notice to the other parties.Section 11.5. Notices to Noteholders; Waiver. Where this Indenture provides for notice to Noteholders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class, postage prepaid to each Noteholder affected by such event, at their address as it appears on the Note Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Noteholders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular Noteholder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Noteholders, and any notice that is mailed in the manner here in provided shall conclusively be presumed to have been duly given.Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by any Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such a waiver.In case, by reason of the suspension of regular mail service as a result of a strike, work stoppage or similar activity, it shall be impractical to mail notice of any event to Noteholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.Section 11.6. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act. If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof that is required to be included in this Indenture by any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, such required provision shall control.The provisions of TIA §§ 310 through 317 that impose duties on any person (including the provisions automatically deemed included herein unless expressly excluded by this Indenture) are a part of and govern this Indenture, whether or not physically contained herein.Section 11.7. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.Section 11.8. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in this Indenture and the Notes by the Issuer shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. All agreements of the Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors. All agreements of the Trust Collateral Agent in this Indenture shall bind its successors.Section 11.9. Separability. In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.Section 11.10. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Notes, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder, the Noteholders, and any other party secured hereunder, and any other person with an Ownership interest in any part of the Trust Estate, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.Section 11.11. Legal Holidays. In any case where the date on which any payment is due shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Notes or this Indenture) payment need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which nominally due, and no interest shall accrue for the period from and after any such nominal date.Section 11.12. Governing Law. THIS INDENTURE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THIS INDENTURE AND ALL MATTERS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS INDENTURE SHALL BE, GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW).Section 11.13. Counterparts. This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.Section 11.14. Recording of Indenture. If this Indenture is subject to recording in any appropriate public recording offices, such recording is to be effected by the Issuer and at its expense accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel (which may be counsel to the Trustee or any other counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee) to the effect that such recording is necessary either for the protection of the Noteholders or any other person secured hereunder or for the enforcement of any right or remedy granted to the Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent under this Indenture.Section 11.15. Trust Obligation. No recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the obligations of the Issuer, the Seller, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent or the Trustee on the Notes or under this Indenture, any other Basic Document or any certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith, against (i) the Seller, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner, beneficiary, agent, officer, director, employee or agent of the Seller, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Seller, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent or the Trustee or of any successor or assign of the Seller, the Servicer, the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed (it being understood that the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent and the Owner Trustee have no such obligations in their individual capacity) and except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock, unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to such entity. For all purposes of this Indenture, in the performance of any duties or obligations of the Issuer hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall be subject to, and entitled to the benefits of, the terms and provisions of Article VI., VII. and VIII. of the Trust Agreement.Section 11.16. No Petition. The Trustee and the Trust Collateral Agent, by entering into this Indenture, and each Noteholder, by accepting a Note, hereby covenant and agree that they will not at any time institute against the Seller, or the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Seller, or the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings, or other proceedings under any United States federal or State bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to the Notes, this Indenture or any of the Basic Documents.Section 11.17. Inspection. The Issuer agrees that, on reasonable prior notice, it will permit any representative of the Trustee, during the Issuer's normal business hours, to examine all the books of account, records, reports, and other papers of the Issuer, to make copies and extracts therefrom, to cause such books to be audited by independent certified public accountants, and to discuss the Issuer's affairs, finances and accounts with the Issuer's officers, employees, and independent certified public accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often as may be reasonably requested. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit (i) disclosure of any and all information that is or becomes publicly known, (ii) disclosure of any and all information (A) if required to do so by any applicable statute, law, rule or regulation, (B) to any government agency or regulatory body having or claiming authority to regulate or oversee any respects of the Trustee's business or that of its affiliates, (C) pursuant to any subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar demand or request of any court, regulatory authority, arbitrator or arbitration to which the Trustee or an affiliate or an officer, director, employer or shareholder thereof is a party, (D) in any preliminary or final offering circular, registration statement or contract or other document pertaining to the transactions contemplated by the Indenture approved in advance by the Servicer or the Issuer or (E) to any independent or internal auditor, agent, employee or attorney of the Trustee having a need to know the same, provided that the Trustee advises such recipient of the confidential nature of the information being disclosed, or (iii) any other disclosure authorized by the Servicer or the Issuer.[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]

SCHEDULE A. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE ISSUER.Representations and Warranties Regarding Receivables1. Security Interest in Financed Vehicle. This Indenture creates a valid and continuing Security Interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Receivables in favor of the Trust Collateral Agent, which Security Interest is prior to all other Liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and purchasers from the Seller. The Issuer owns and has good and marketable title to the Receivables free and clear of any Lien (other than the Lien in favor of the Trust Collateral Agent), claim or encumbrance of any Person.2. Perfection of Security Interest. Each Receivable is secured by a first priority validly perfected security interest in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Trust Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Issuer Secured Party or all necessary actions with respect to such Receivable have been taken or will be taken to perfect a first priority security interest in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Trust Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Issuer Secured Party.3. All Filings Made. The Issuer has taken all steps necessary to perfect the Trust Collateral Agent's security interest in the property securing the Receivables, provided that, if not done as of the Closing Date, the Issuer will cause, within ten days of the Closing Date, the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in the State of Delaware under applicable law in order to perfect the security interest in the Receivables granted to the Trust Collateral Agent hereunder. All financing statements filed or to be filed against the Issuer in favor of the Trust Collateral Agent in connection herewith describing the Receivables contain a statement to the following effect: "A purchase of or a security interest in any collateral described in this financing statement will violate the rights of the Trust Collateral Agent."4. No Impairment. The Issuer has not done anything to convey any right to any Person that would result in such Person having a right to payments due under the Receivable or otherwise to impair the rights of the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent and the Noteholders in any Receivable or the proceeds thereof. Other than the security interest granted to the Trust Collateral Agent pursuant to this Indenture, the Issuer has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Receivables. The Issuer has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing statements against the Issuer that include a description of collateral covering the Receivables other than any financing statement relating to the security interest granted to the Trust Collateral Agent hereunder or that has been terminated. The Issuer is not aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against it.5. Chattel Paper. The Receivables constitute "tangible chattel paper" or "electronic chattel paper" within the meaning of the UCC as in effect in the States of [__] and Delaware.6. Good Title. Immediately prior to the pledge of the Receivables to the Trust Collateral Agent pursuant to this Indenture, the Issuer was the sole owner thereof and had good and indefeasible title thereto, free of any Lien and, upon execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Trust shall have good and indefeasible title to and will be the sole owner of such Receivables, free of any Lien.

The Servicer’s receipt of a Receivable and/or Receivable File shall obligate the Servicer to return the original Receivable and the related Receivable File to the Custodian when its need by the Servicer has ceased unless the Receivable is repurchased as described in Section 3.2., 4.2. or 4.7..ARTICLE IV. DUTIES OF THE SERVICER. Section 4.1. Duties of the Servicer The Servicer is hereby authorized to act as agent for the Trust and in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and make collections on the Receivables, and perform the other actions required by the Servicer under this Agreement. The Servicer agrees that its servicing of the Receivables shall be carried out in accordance with customary and usual procedures of institutions which service motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts and, to the extent more exacting, the degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises from time to time with respect to all comparable motor vehicle receivables that it services for itself or others. In performing such duties, so long as [(name of Servicer)] is the Servicer, it shall substantially comply with the policies and procedures described on Schedule C, as such policies and procedures may be updated from time to time. The Servicer’s duties shall include, without limitation, collecting and posting all payments, responding to inquiries of Obligors on the Receivables, investigating delinquencies, sending payment coupons to Obligors, reporting any required tax information to Obligors, monitoring the collateral, complying with the terms of the Lockbox Agreements, accounting for collections and furnishing monthly and annual statements to the Trust Collateral Agent and the Trustee with respect to distributions, monitoring the status of Insurance Policies with respect to the Financed Vehicles and performing the other duties specified herein.The Servicer, or if [(name of Servicer)] is no longer the Servicer, [(name of Servicer)], at the request of the Servicer, shall also administer and enforce all rights and responsibilities of the holder of the Receivables provided for in the Dealer Agreements and Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreements (and shall maintain possession of the Dealer Agreements and Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreements, to the extent it is necessary to do so), the Dealer Assignments, the Third-Party Lender Assignments and the Insurance Policies, to the extent that such Dealer Agreements, Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreements, Dealer Assignments, Third-Party Lender Assignments and Insurance Policies relate to the Receivables, the Financed Vehicles or the Obligors. To the extent consistent with the standards, policies and procedures otherwise required hereby, the Servicer shall follow its customary standards, policies, and procedures and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with such managing, servicing, administration and collection that it may deem necessary or desirable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered by the Trust to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trust, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables and with respect to the Financed Vehicles; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not, except pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, release an Obligor from payment of any unpaid amount under any Receivable or waive the right to collect the unpaid balance of any Receivable from the Obligor, except in accordance with the Servicer’s customary practices as reflected in the servicing policies and procedures attached hereto as Schedule C.The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its own name or in the name of the Trust, a legal proceeding to enforce a Receivable pursuant to Section 4.3. or to commence or participate in any other legal proceeding (including, without limitation, a bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or involving a Receivable, an Obligor or a Financed Vehicle. If the Servicer commences or participates in such a legal proceeding in its own name, the Trust shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned such Receivable to the Servicer solely for purposes of commencing or participating in any such proceeding as a party or claimant, and the Servicer is authorized and empowered by the Trust to execute and deliver in the Servicer’s name any notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses, affidavits or other documents or instruments in connection with any such proceeding. The Trust Collateral Agent and the Owner Trustee shall furnish the Servicer with any limited powers of attorney and other documents which the Servicer may reasonably request and which the Servicer deems necessary or appropriate and take any other steps which the Servicer may deem necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement.As set forth in Section 9.3., in the event the Servicer fails to perform its obligations hereunder, the successor Servicer shall be responsible for the Servicer’s duties in this Agreement as if it were the Servicer, provided that the successor Servicer shall not be liable for the Servicer’s breach of its obligations.Section 4.2. Collection of Receivable Payments; Modifications of Receivables; Lockbox Agreements. (a) Consistent with the standards, policies and procedures required by this Agreement, the Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Receivables as and when the same shall become due, and shall follow such collection procedures as it follows with respect to all comparable automobile receivables that it services for itself or others and otherwise act with respect to the Receivables, the Dealer Agreements, the Dealer Assignments, the Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreements, the Third-Party Lender Assignments, the Insurance Policies and the Other Conveyed Property in such manner as will, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer, maximize the amount to be received by the Trust with respect thereto, including directing the Issuer to sell the Receivables pursuant to Section 4.3.(c) hereof. The Servicer is authorized in its discretion to waive any prepayment charge, late payment charge or any other similar fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing any Receivable.(b) The Servicer may (A) at any time agree to a modification or amendment of a Receivable in order to (i) not more than once per year, change the Obligor’s regular monthly due date to a date that shall in no event be later than 30 days after the original monthly due date of that Receivable, in accordance with its customary procedures or (ii) re-amortize the Scheduled Receivables Payments on the Receivable (x) following a partial prepayment of principal, in accordance with its customary procedures or (y) following the Obligor’s reinstatement based on local laws or (B) may direct the Issuer to sell the Receivables pursuant to Section 4.3. hereof, if the Servicer believes in good faith that such extension, modification, amendment or sale is necessary to avoid a default on such Receivable, will maximize the amount to be received by the Trust with respect to such Receivable, and is otherwise in the best interests of the Trust.(c) The Servicer may grant payment extensions on, or other modifications or amendments to, a receivable (in addition to those modifications permitted by Section 4.2.(b) hereof), in accordance with its customary procedures if the Servicer believes in good faith that such extension, modification or amendment is necessary to avoid a default on such Receivable, will maximize the amount to be received by the Trust with respect to such Receivable, and is otherwise in the best interests of the Trust; provided, however, that:(1) The aggregate period of all extensions on a Receivable shall not exceed [number] months; and(2) In no event may a Receivable be extended beyond the Collection Period immediately preceding the latest Final Scheduled Distribution Date.(d) The Servicer, acting as agent for the Trust pursuant to the Lockbox Account Agreement, shall use its best efforts to notify or direct Obligors to make all payments on the Receivables, whether by check or by direct debit of the Obligor’s bank account, to be made directly to one or more Lockbox Banks or Lockbox Processors pursuant to the Lockbox Agreements. The Servicer shall use its best efforts to notify or direct any Lockbox Bank or Lockbox Processor to deposit all payments on the Receivables in the Lockbox Account no later than the Business Day after receipt, and to cause all amounts credited to the Lockbox Account on account of such payments to be transferred to the Collection Account no later than the second Business Day after receipt of such payments. The Lockbox Account shall be a demand deposit account held by the Lockbox Bank.Prior to the Closing Date, the Servicer shall have notified each Obligor that makes its payments on the Receivables by check to make such payments thereafter directly to the Lockbox Processor (except in the case of Obligors that have already been making such payments to the Lockbox Processor), and shall have provided each such Obligor with remittance invoices in order to enable such Obligors to make such payments directly to the Lockbox Processor for deposit into the Lockbox Account, and the Servicer will continue, not less often than every three months, to so notify those Obligors who have failed to make payments to the Lockbox Processor. If at any time, an Obligor’s bank account cannot be accessed by direct debit and if such inability is not cured within [15] days or cannot be cured by execution by the Obligor of a new authorization for automatic payment, the Servicer shall notify such Obligor that it cannot make payment by direct debit and must thereafter make payment by check.Notwithstanding any Lockbox Agreement, or any of the provisions of this Agreement relating to the Lockbox Agreements, the Servicer shall remain obligated and liable to the Trust, the Trust Collateral Agent and Noteholders for servicing and administering the Receivables and the Other Conveyed Property in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue thereof.In the event of a termination of the Servicer, the successor Servicer shall assume all of the rights and obligations of the outgoing Servicer under the Lockbox Agreements subject to the terms hereof. In such event, the successor Servicer shall be deemed to have assumed all of the outgoing Servicer’s interest therein and to have replaced the outgoing Servicer as a party to each such Lockbox Agreement to the same extent as if such Lockbox Agreements had been assigned to the successor Servicer, except that the outgoing Servicer shall not thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations on the part of the outgoing Servicer to the Lockbox Bank or the Lockbox Processor under such Lockbox Agreements. The outgoing Servicer shall, upon request of the Trust Collateral Agent, but at the expense of the outgoing Servicer, deliver to the successor Servicer all documents and records relating to each such Lockbox Agreement and an accounting of amounts collected and held by the Lockbox Processor and the Lockbox Bank and otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of the Lockbox Agreements to the successor Servicer. In the event that the [Majority Noteholders] elect to change the identity of the Lockbox Bank or Lockbox Processor, the outgoing Servicer, at its expense, shall cause the Lockbox Bank or Lockbox Processor to deliver, at the direction of the [Majority Noteholders] to the Trust Collateral Agent or a successor Lockbox Bank or Lockbox Processor, all documents and records relating to the Receivables and all amounts held (or thereafter received) by the Lockbox Bank or the Lockbox Processor (together with an accounting of such amounts) and shall otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of the lockbox arrangements and the Servicer shall notify the Obligors to make payments to the lockbox arrangements established by the successor.(e) The Servicer shall remit all payments by or on behalf of the Obligors received directly by the Servicer to the Lockbox Bank as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the second Business Day after receipt thereof, and such amounts shall be deposited into the Lockbox Account and transferred from the Lockbox Account to the Collection Account in accordance with Section 4.2.(d) hereof.(f) [(name of Servicer)] shall not cause or permit the substitution of the Financed Vehicle relating to a Receivable unless: (i) the substitution is a replacement of the Financed Vehicle originally financed under the related Receivable; (ii) the Financed Vehicle originally financed under the related Receivable was either (x) insured under an Insurance Policy as required under Section 4.4.(a) at the time of a casualty loss that is treated as a total loss under such Insurance Policy, (y) deemed to be a "lemon" pursuant to applicable state law and repurchased by the related Dealer or (z) the subject of an order by a court of competent jurisdiction directing [(name of Servicer)] to substitute another vehicle under the related Receivable; (iii) the related Receivable is not more than [30] days delinquent; (iv) the Obligor is deemed to be in "good standing" by the Servicer and is not in breach of any requirement under the related Receivable; (v) the replacement Financed Vehicle has a book value (N.A.D.A.) at least equal to the book value (N.A.D.A.) of the Financed Vehicle that is being replaced, measured immediately before the casualty loss or replacement by the Dealer and (vi) as of the date of such substitution, the replacement Financed Vehicle’s mileage is no greater than the mileage on the Financed Vehicle that is being replaced; provided, however, that if the substitution is made pursuant to clause (ii)(z), above, clauses (iii) through (vi) inclusive, shall not be applicable. [(name of Servicer)] shall not cause or permit the substitution of Financed Vehicles relating to Receivables having an original aggregate Principal Balance greater than [two percent (2%)] of the Original Pool Balance, (the "Substitution Limit"). In the event that the Substitution Limit is exceeded for any reason, (i) [(name of Servicer)] shall, on or before the next following Accounting Date, repurchase a sufficient number of such Receivables to cause the aggregate original Principal Balances of such Receivables to be less than the Substitution Limit or (ii) if [(name of Servicer)] is not the Servicer and the Servicer has caused substitutions to be made hereunder pursuant to the circumstances described in clause (ii)(x), above, the Servicer shall, on or before the next following Accounting Date, repurchase a sufficient number of such Receivables to cause the aggregate original Principal Balances of such Receivables to be less than the Substitution Limit.Section 4.3. Realization upon Receivables. (a) In addition to the Servicer’s ability to direct the Issuer to sell Receivables pursuant to Section 4.3.(c) hereof, and consistent with the standards, policies and procedures required by this Agreement, the Servicer shall use its best efforts to repossess (or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of) and liquidate any Financed Vehicle securing a Receivable with respect to which the Servicer has determined that payments thereunder are not likely to be resumed, as soon as is practicable; provided, however, that the Servicer may elect not to repossess a Financed Vehicle if in its good faith judgment it determines that the proceeds ultimately recoverable with respect to such Receivable would be increased by forbearance or if it instead elects to direct the Issuer to sell the Receivables pursuant to Section 4.3.(c). The Servicer is authorized to follow such customary practices and procedures as it shall deem necessary or advisable, consistent with the standard of care required by Section 4.1., which practices and procedures may include reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to Dealers and Third-Party Lenders, the sale of the related Financed Vehicle at public or private sale, the submission of claims under an Insurance Policy and other actions by the Servicer in order to realize upon such a Receivable. The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered damage, the Servicer shall not expend funds in connection with any repair or towards the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it expects in its sole discretion, that such repair and/or repossession shall increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related Receivable by an amount greater than the amount of such expenses. All amounts received upon liquidation of a Financed Vehicle shall be remitted directly by the Servicer to the Collection Account without deposit into any intervening account as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the Business Day after receipt thereof. The Servicer shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses incurred by it in the course of repossessing and liquidating a Financed Vehicle into cash proceeds, but only out of the cash proceeds of such Financed Vehicle, any deficiency obtained from the Obligor or any amounts received from the related Dealer or Third-Party Lender, which amounts in reimbursement may be retained by the Servicer (and shall not be required to be deposited as provided in Section 4.2.(e)) to the extent of such expenses. The Servicer shall pay on behalf of the Trust any personal property taxes assessed on repossessed Financed Vehicles. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of any such tax from Net Liquidation Proceeds with respect to such Receivable.(b) If the Servicer, or if [(name of Servicer)] is no longer the Servicer, [(name of Servicer)] at the request of the Servicer, elects to commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Dealer Agreement, Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement, Dealer Assignment or Third-Party Lender Assignment, the act of commencement shall be deemed to be an automatic assignment from the Trust to the Servicer, or to [(name of Servicer)] at the request of the Servicer, of the rights under such Dealer Agreement, Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement, Dealer Assignment or Third-Party Lender Assignment for purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer or [(name of Servicer)], as appropriate, may not enforce a Dealer Agreement, Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement, Dealer Assignment or Third-Party Lender Assignment on the grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a Person entitled to enforce the Dealer Agreement, Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement, Dealer Assignment or Third-Party Lender Assignment, the Owner Trustee and/or the Trust Collateral Agent, at [(name of Servicer)]’s expense, or the Seller, at the Seller’s expense, shall take such steps as the Servicer deems reasonably necessary to enforce the Dealer Agreement, Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreement, Dealer Assignment or Third-Party Lender Assignment, including bringing suit in its name or the name of the Seller or of the Trust and the Owner Trustee and/or the Trust Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Noteholders. All amounts recovered shall be remitted directly by the Servicer as provided in Section 4.2.(e).(c) Consistent with the standards, policies and procedures required by this Agreement, the Servicer may use its best efforts to locate a third party purchaser that is not affiliated with the Servicer, the Seller or the Issuer to purchase from the Issuer any Receivable that has become more than 60 days delinquent, and shall have the right to direct the Issuer to sell any such Receivable to the third-party purchaser; provided, that no more than [20]% of the number of Receivables in the pool as of the Cutoff Date may be sold by the Issuer pursuant to this Section 4.3.(c) in the aggregate; provided further, that the Servicer may elect to not direct the Issuer to sell a Receivable that has become more than [60] days delinquent if in its good faith judgment the Servicer determines that the proceeds ultimately recoverable with respect to such Receivable would be increased by forbearance. In selecting Receivables to be sold to a third party purchaser pursuant to this Section 4.3.(c), the Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to locate purchasers for the most delinquent Receivables first. In any event, the Servicer shall not use any procedure in selecting Receivables to be sold to third party purchasers which is materially adverse to the interest of the Noteholders. The Issuer shall sell each Sold Receivable for the greatest market price possible; provided, however, that aggregate Sale Amounts received by the Issuer for all Receivables sold to a single third-party purchaser on a single date must be at least equal to the sum of the Minimum Sale Prices for all such Receivables. The Servicer shall remit or cause the third-party purchaser to remit all sale proceeds from the sale of Receivables to the Collection Account without deposit into any intervening account as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the Business Day after receipt thereof.Section 4.4. Insurance. (a) The Servicer shall require, in accordance with its customary servicing policies and procedures, that each Financed Vehicle be insured by the related Obligor under the Insurance Policies referred to in Paragraph [27] of the Schedule of Representations and Warranties and shall monitor the status of such physical loss and damage insurance coverage thereafter, in accordance with its customary servicing procedures. Each Receivable requires the Obligor to maintain such physical loss and damage insurance, naming [(name of Servicer)], an Originating Affiliate or a Titled Third-Party Lender (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction) and its successors and assigns as additional insureds, and permits the holder of such Receivable to obtain physical loss and damage insurance at the expense of the Obligor if the Obligor fails to maintain such insurance. If the Servicer shall determine that an Obligor has failed to obtain or maintain a physical loss and damage Insurance Policy covering the related Financed Vehicle which satisfies the conditions set forth in clause (i)(a) of such Paragraph [27] (including, without limitation, during the repossession of such Financed Vehicle) the Servicer may enforce the rights of the holder of the Receivable under the Receivable to require the Obligor to obtain such physical loss and damage insurance in accordance with its customary servicing policies and procedures. The Servicer may maintain a vendor’s single interest or other collateral protection insurance policy with respect to all Financed Vehicles ("Collateral Insurance") which policy shall by its terms insure against physical loss and damage in the event any Obligor fails to maintain physical loss and damage insurance with respect to the related Financed Vehicle. The Servicer shall cause itself, an Originating Affiliate or a Titled Third-Party Lender, and may cause the Trust Collateral Agent (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction), to be named as named insured under all policies of Collateral Insurance. Costs incurred by the Servicer in maintaining such Collateral Insurance shall be paid by the Servicer.(b) The Servicer may, if an Obligor fails to obtain or maintain a physical loss and damage Insurance Policy, obtain insurance with respect to the related Financed Vehicle and advance on behalf of such Obligor, as required under the terms of the insurance policy, the premiums for such insurance (such insurance being referred to herein as "Force-Placed Insurance"). All policies of Force-Placed Insurance shall be endorsed with clauses providing for loss payable to the Servicer. Any cost incurred by the Servicer in maintaining such Force-Placed Insurance shall only be recoverable out of premiums paid by the Obligors or Net Liquidation Proceeds with respect to the Receivable, as provided in Section 4.4.(c).(c) In connection with any Force-Placed Insurance obtained hereunder, the Servicer may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by applicable law, require the Obligors to repay the entire premium to the Servicer. In no event shall the Servicer include the amount of the premium in the Amount Financed under the Receivable. For all purposes of this Agreement, the Insurance Add-On Amount with respect to any Receivable having Force-Placed Insurance will be treated as a separate obligation of the Obligor and will not be added to the Principal Balance of such Receivable, and amounts allocable thereto will not be available for distribution on the Notes and the Certificate. The Servicer shall retain and separately administer the right to receive payments from Obligors with respect to Insurance Add-On Amounts or rebates of Forced-Placed Insurance premiums. If an Obligor makes a payment with respect to a Receivable having Force-Placed Insurance, but the Servicer is unable to determine whether the payment is allocable to the Receivable or to the Insurance Add-On Amount, the payment shall be applied first to any unpaid Scheduled Receivables Payments and then to the Insurance Add-On Amount. Net Liquidation Proceeds on any Receivable will be used first to pay the Principal Balance and accrued interest on such Receivable and then to pay the related Insurance Add-On Amount. If an Obligor under a Receivable with respect to which the Servicer has placed Force-Placed Insurance fails to make scheduled payments of such Insurance Add-On Amount as due, and the Servicer has determined that eventual payment of the Insurance Add-On Amount is unlikely, the Servicer may, but shall not be required to, purchase such Receivable from the Trust for the Purchase Amount on any subsequent Determination Date. Any such Receivable, and any Receivable with respect to which the Servicer has placed Force-Placed Insurance which has been paid in full (excluding any Insurance Add-On Amounts) will be assigned to the Servicer.(d) The Servicer may sue to enforce or collect upon the Insurance Policies, in its own name, if possible, or as agent of the Trust. If the Servicer elects to commence a legal proceeding to enforce an Insurance Policy, the act of commencement shall be deemed to be an automatic assignment of the rights of the Trust under such Insurance Policy to the Servicer for purposes of collection only. If, however, in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce an Insurance Policy on the grounds that it is not a real party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Insurance Policy, the Owner Trustee and/or the Trust Collateral Agent, at the Servicer’s expense, or the Seller, at the Seller’s expense, shall take such steps as the Servicer deems necessary to enforce such Insurance Policy, including bringing suit in its name or the name of the Trust and the Owner Trustee and/or the Trust Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Noteholders.Section 4.5. Maintenance of Security Interests in Vehicles. (a) Consistent with the policies and procedures required by this Agreement, the Servicer shall take such steps on behalf of the Trust as are necessary to maintain perfection of the security interest created by each Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle, including, but not limited to, obtaining the execution by the Obligors and the recording, registering, filing, re-recording, re-filing, and re-registering of all security agreements, financing statements and continuation statements as are necessary to maintain the security interest granted by the Obligors under the respective Receivables. The Trust Collateral Agent hereby authorizes the Servicer, and the Servicer agrees, to take any and all steps necessary to re-perfect such security interest on behalf of the Trust as necessary because of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any other reason. In the event that the assignment of a Receivable to the Trust is insufficient, without a notation on the related Financed Vehicle’s certificate of title, or without fulfilling any additional administrative requirements under the laws of the state in which the Financed Vehicle is located, to perfect a security interest in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Trust, the Servicer hereby agrees that the designation of [(name of Servicer)], an Originating Affiliate or a Titled Third-Party Lender (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction) as the secured party on the Lien Certificate is in its capacity as Servicer as agent of the Trust.(b) Upon the occurrence of a Servicer Termination Event, the Trust Collateral Agent and the Servicer shall take or cause to be taken such action as may, in the Opinion of Counsel to the [Majority Noteholders], be necessary to perfect or re-perfect the security interests in the Financed Vehicles securing the Receivables in the name of the Trust by amending the title documents of such Financed Vehicles or by such other reasonable means as may, in the Opinion of Counsel to the [Majority Noteholders], be necessary or prudent.[(name of Servicer)] hereby agrees to pay all expenses related to such perfection or reperfection and to take all action necessary therefor. [(name of Servicer)] hereby appoints the Trust Collateral Agent as its attorney-in-fact to take any and all steps required to be performed by [(name of Servicer)] pursuant to this Section 4.5.(b) (it being understood that and agreed that the Trust Collateral Agent shall have no obligation to take such steps with respect to all perfection or reperfection, except as pursuant to the Basic Documents to which it is a party and to which [(name of Servicer)] has paid all expenses), including execution of Lien Certificates or any other documents in the name and stead of [(name of Servicer)] (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction), and the Trust Collateral Agent hereby accepts such appointment.Section 4.6. Covenants, Representations, and Warranties of Servicer. By its execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Servicer makes the following representations, warranties and covenants on which the Trust Collateral Agent relies in accepting the Receivables and on which the Trustee relies in authenticating the Notes.(a) The Servicer covenants as follows:(1) Liens in Force. The Financed Vehicle securing each Receivable shall not be released in whole or in part from the security interest granted by the Receivable, except upon payment in full of the Receivable or as otherwise contemplated herein;(2) No Impairment. The Servicer shall do nothing to impair the rights of the Trust or the Noteholders in the Receivables, the Dealer Agreements, the Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreements, the Dealer Assignments, the Third-Party Lender Assignments, the Insurance Policies or the Other Conveyed Property except as otherwise expressly provided herein;(3) No Amendments. The Servicer shall not extend or otherwise amend the terms of any Receivable, except in accordance with Section 4.2.; and(4) Restrictions on Liens. The Servicer shall not (A) create, incur or suffer to exist, or agree to create, incur or suffer to exist, or consent to cause or permit in the future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) the creation, incurrence or existence of any Lien or restriction on transferability of the Receivables except for the Lien in favor of the Trust Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Noteholders and the restrictions on transferability imposed by this Agreement or (B) sign or file under the Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction any financing statement which names [(name of Servicer)] or the Servicer as a debtor, or sign any security agreement authorizing any secured party thereunder to file such financing statement, with respect to the Receivables, except in each case any such instrument solely securing the rights and preserving the Lien of the Trust Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Noteholders.(b) The Servicer represents, warrants and covenants as of the Closing Date as to itself that the representations and warranties set forth on the Schedule of Representations attached hereto as Schedule B are true and correct; provided that such representations and warranties contained therein and herein shall not apply to any entity other than [(name of Servicer)].Section 4.7. Purchase of Receivables Upon Breach of Covenant. Upon discovery by any of the Servicer, a Responsible Officer of the Trust Collateral Agent, the Owner Trustee or a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Sections 1, 2 or 3 of the Custodian Agreement or in Sections 4.5.(a) or 4.6. hereof, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the others; provided, however, that the failure to give any such notice shall not affect any obligation of [(name of Servicer)] as Servicer under this Section. As of the second Accounting Date following its discovery or receipt of notice of any breach of any covenant set forth in Section 3(b) of the Custodian Agreement or Sections 4.5.(a) or 4.6. hereof which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Noteholders in any Receivable (including any Liquidated Receivable) (or, at [(name of Servicer)]'s election, the first Accounting Date so following) or the related Financed Vehicle, [(name of Servicer)] shall, unless such breach shall have been cured in all material respects, purchase from the Trust the Receivable affected by such breach and, on the related Determination Date, [(name of Servicer)] shall pay the related Purchase Amount. It is understood and agreed that the obligation of [(name of Servicer)] to purchase any Receivable (including any Liquidated Receivable) with respect to which such a breach has occurred and is continuing shall, if such obligation is fulfilled, constitute the sole remedy against [(name of Servicer)] for such breach available to the Noteholders, the Owner Trustee or the Trust Collateral Agent; provided, however, that [(name of Servicer)] shall indemnify the Trust, the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the Noteholders from and against all costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims and liabilities, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, which may be asserted against or incurred by any of them as a result of third party claims arising out of the events or facts giving rise to such breach. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, [(name of Servicer)] will not be required to repurchase Receivables due solely to the Servicer's not having received Lien Certificates that have been properly applied for from the Registrar of Titles in the applicable states for such Receivables unless (i) such Lien Certificates shall not have been received with respect to Receivables with Principal Balances which total more than 1.0% of the Aggregate Principal Balance as of the [180th] day after the Closing Date, in which case [(name of Servicer)] shall be required to repurchase a sufficient number of such Receivables to cause the aggregate Principal Balances of the remaining Receivables for which no such Lien Certificate shall have been received to be no greater than [1.0]% of the Aggregate Principal Balance as of such date or (ii) such Lien Certificates shall not have been received as of the [240th] day after the Closing Date. This Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the earlier removal or resignation of the Trustee and/or the Trust Collateral Agent.Section 4.8. Total Servicing Fee; Payment of Certain Expenses by Servicer. On each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive out of the Collection Account the Base Servicing Fee and any Supplemental Servicing Fee for the related Collection Period (together, the "Servicing Fee") pursuant to Section 5.7.. The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this Agreement (including taxes imposed on the Servicer, expenses incurred in connection with distributions and reports made by the Servicer to the Noteholders and all other fees and expenses of the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent or the Trustee, except taxes levied or assessed against the Trust, and claims against the Trust in respect of indemnification, which taxes and claims in respect of indemnification against the Trust are expressly stated to be for the account of [(name of Servicer)]). The Servicer shall be liable for the fees and expenses of the Owner Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Lockbox Bank (and any fees under the Lockbox Account Agreement), the Lockbox Processor (and any fees under the Lockbox Processing Agreement) and the Independent Accountants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Servicer shall not be [(name of Servicer)], a successor to [(name of Servicer)] as Servicer permitted by Section 9.3. shall not be liable for taxes levied or assessed against the Trust or claims against the Trust in respect of indemnification, or the fees and expenses referred to above.Section 4.9.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if each Rating Agency then rating the Notes notifies the Seller (who shall send such notification to the Trust Collateral Agent) in writing that the use of any such new formula, and any decrease in the amount of the Specified Reserve Balance or change in the manner by which the Reserve Account is funded, will not result in the qualification, reduction or withdrawal of its then current rating of the Notes then the Specified Reserve Balance will be determined in accordance with such new formula and this Agreement will be amended to reflect such new formula without the consent of any Noteholder.(3) On each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall instruct the Trust Collateral Agent (based on the information contained in the Servicer's Certificate delivered on the related Determination Date) (A) if the amount on deposit in the Reserve Account (without taking into account any amount on deposit in the Reserve Account representing net investment earnings) is less than the Specified Reserve Balance, in which case the Trust Collateral Agent shall, after payment of any amounts required to be distributed pursuant to clauses (1) through (18) of Section 5.7.(a) deposit in the Reserve Account the Reserve Account Deposit Amount pursuant to Section 5.7.5.7.(19), and (B) if the amount on deposit in the Reserve Account, after giving effect to all other deposits thereto and withdrawals therefrom to be made on such Distribution Date is greater than the Specified Reserve Balance, in which case the Trust Collateral Agent shall distribute the amount of such excess as part of Available Funds on such Distribution Date.(b) On each Distribution Date, the Servicer shall instruct the Trust Collateral Agent (based on the information contained in the Servicer's Certificate delivered on the related Determination Date) to withdraw the Reserve Account Withdrawal Amount from the Reserve Account and deposit such amounts in the Collection Account to be included as Total Available Funds for that Distribution Date.(c) Amounts properly transferred to the Certificate Distribution Account for payment to the Certificateholder pursuant to this Agreement shall not be available to the Trust Collateral Agent or the Trust for the purpose of making deposits to the Reserve Account, or making payments to the Noteholders, nor shall the Certificateholder be required to refund any amount properly received by them.Section 5.9.

For assistance with regard to this service, Noteholders can call the Trust Collateral Agent's Corporate Trust Office at [location]. The Trust Collateral Agent shall have the right to change the way the statements referred to in Section 5.9.(a) above are distributed in order to make such distribution more convenient and/or more accessible to the parties entitled to receive such statements so long as such statements are only provided to the then current Noteholders. The Trust Collateral Agent shall provide notification of any such change to all parties entitled to receive such statements in the manner described in Section 12.13. hereof, Section 11.4 of the Indenture or Section 11.5 of the Indenture, as appropriate.ARTICLE VI. [RESERVED].ARTICLE VII.

With respect to Contracts that are "electronic chattel paper", each authoritative copy (a) is unique, identifiable and unalterable (other than with the participation of the Trust Collateral Agent in the case of an addition or amendment of an identified assignee and other than a revision that is readily identifiable as an authorized or unauthorized revision), (b) has been marked with a legend to the following effect: "Authoritative Copy" and (c) has been communicated to and is maintained by or on behalf of the Custodian.14. Not an Authoritative Copy. With respect to Contracts that are "electronic chattel paper", the Seller has marked all copies of each such Contract other than an authoritative copy with a legend to the following effect: "This is not an authoritative copy."15. Revisions. With respect to Contracts that are "electronic chattel paper", the related Receivables have been established in a manner such that (a) all copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy of each such Contract must be made with the participation of the Trust Collateral Agent and (b) all revisions of the authoritative copy of each such Contract are readily identifiable as an authorized or unauthorized revision.16. Pledge or Assignment. With respect to Contracts that are "electronic chattel paper", the authoritative copy of each Contract communicated to the Custodian has no marks or notations indicating that it has been pledged, assigned or otherwise conveyed to any Person other than the Trust Collateral Agent.17. Receivable Files Complete. There exists a Receivable File pertaining to each Receivable and such Receivable File contains the original Lien Certificate or a copy of the application therefor. Related documentation concerning the Receivable, including any documentation regarding modifications of the Contract, will be maintained electronically by the Servicer in accordance with customary policies and procedures. Each of such documents which is required to be signed by the Obligor has been signed by the Obligor in the appropriate spaces. All blanks on any form have been properly filled in and each form has otherwise been correctly prepared. With respect to any Receivables that are tangible chattel paper, the complete Receivable File, including a fully executed original of the Contract, for each Receivable currently is in the possession of the Custodian.18. Receivables in Force. No Receivable has been satisfied, subordinated or rescinded, and the Financed Vehicle securing each such Receivable has not been released from the lien of the related Receivable in whole or in part. No terms of any Receivable have been waived, altered or modified in any respect since its origination, except by instruments or documents identified in the Receivable File or the Servicer's electronic records.19. Lawful Assignment. No Receivable was originated in, or is subject to the laws of, any jurisdiction the laws of which would make unlawful, void or voidable the sale, transfer and assignment of such Receivable under this Agreement or pursuant to transfers of the Notes. The Seller has not entered into any agreement with any Person that prohibits, restricts or conditions the sale of any Receivable by the Seller.20. Good Title. Immediately prior to the conveyance of the Receivables to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller was the sole owner thereof and had good and indefeasible title thereto, free of any Lien and, upon execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, the Trust shall have good and indefeasible title to and will be the sole owner of such Receivables, free of any Lien. No Dealer or Third-Party Lender has a participation in, or other right to receive, proceeds of any Receivable. The Seller has not taken any action to convey any right to any Person that would result in such Person having a right to payments received under the related Insurance Policies or the related Dealer Agreements, Auto Loan Purchase and Sale Agreements, Dealer Assignments or Third-Party Lender Assignments or to payments due under such Receivables.21. Security Interest in Financed Vehicle. Each Receivable created or shall create a valid, binding and enforceable first priority security interest in favor of [(name of Servicer)] (or an Originating Affiliate or a Titled Third-Party Lender which first priority security interest has been assigned to [(name of Servicer)]) in the Financed Vehicle. The Lien Certificate for each Financed Vehicle shows, or if a new or replacement Lien Certificate is being applied for with respect to such Financed Vehicle the Lien Certificate will be received within 180 days of the Closing Date and will show, [(name of Servicer)], an Originating Affiliate or a Titled Third-Party Lender named (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction) as the original secured party under each Receivable as the holder of a first priority security interest in such Financed Vehicle. With respect to each Receivable for which the Lien Certificate has not yet been returned from the Registrar of Titles, [(name of Servicer)] or the related Originating Affiliate has applied for or received written evidence from the related Dealer or Third-Party Lender that such Lien Certificate showing [(name of Servicer)], an Originating Affiliate, the Issuer or a Titled Third-Party Lender (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction), as applicable, as first lienholder has been applied for and the Originating Affiliate's or Titled Third-Party Lender's security interest has been validly assigned by the Originating Affiliate or Titled Third-Party Lender, as applicable, to [(name of Servicer)] and [(name of Servicer)]'s security interest (assigned by [(name of Servicer)] to the Seller pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) has been validly assigned by the Seller to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement creates a valid and continuing security interest (as defined in the UCC) in the Receivables in favor of the Trust, which security interest is prior to all other Liens, and is enforceable as such against creditors of and purchasers from the Seller. Immediately after the sale, transfer and assignment by the Seller to the Trust, each Receivable will be secured by an enforceable and perfected first priority security interest in the Financed Vehicle in favor of the Trust Collateral Agent as secured party, which security interest is prior to all other Liens upon and security interests in such Financed Vehicle which now exist or may hereafter arise or be created (except, as to priority, for any lien for taxes, labor or materials affecting a Financed Vehicle). As of the Cutoff Date, there were no Liens or claims for taxes, work, labor or materials affecting a Financed Vehicle which are or may be Liens prior or equal to the Liens of the related Receivable.22. All Filings Made. All filings (including, without limitation, UCC filings (including, without limitation, the filing by the Seller of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in the State of [state name] under applicable law in order to perfect the security interest in the Receivables granted to the Trust hereunder)) required to be made by any Person and actions required to be taken or performed by any Person in any jurisdiction to give the Trust and the Trust Collateral Agent a first priority perfected lien on, or ownership interest in, the Receivables and the proceeds thereof and the Other Conveyed Property have been made, taken or performed.23. No Impairment. The Seller has not done anything to convey any right to any Person that would result in such Person having a right to payments due under the Receivables or otherwise to impair the rights of the Trust, the Trustee, the Trust Collateral Agent and the Noteholders in any Receivable or the proceeds thereof. Other than the security interest granted to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement and except any other security interests that have been fully released and discharged as of the Closing Date, the Seller has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Receivables. The Seller has not authorized the filing of and is not aware of any financing statements against the Seller that include a description of collateral covering the Receivables other than any financing statement relating to the security interest granted to the Trust hereunder or that has been terminated. The Seller is not aware of any judgment, ERISA or tax lien filings against it.24. Receivable Not Assumable. No Receivable is assumable by another Person in a manner which would release the Obligor thereof from such Obligor's obligations to the owner thereof with respect to such Receivable.25. No Defenses. No Receivable is subject to any right of rescission, setoff, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and the operation of any of the terms of any Receivable, or the exercise of any right thereunder, will not render such Receivable unenforceable in whole or in part and no such right has been asserted or threatened with respect to any Receivable.26. No Default. There has been no default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration under the terms of any Receivable (other than payment delinquencies of not more than 30 days), and no condition exists or event has occurred and is continuing that with notice, the lapse of time or both would constitute a default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration under the terms of any Receivable, and there has been no waiver of any of the foregoing. As of the Cutoff Date no Financed Vehicle had been repossessed.27. Insurance. At the time of an origination of a Receivable by [(name of Servicer)], an Originating Affiliate, a Dealer or Third-Party Lender, each Financed Vehicle is required to be covered by a comprehensive and collision insurance policy (i) in an amount at least equal to the lesser of (a) its maximum insurable value and (b) the principal amount due from the Obligor under the related Receivable, (ii) naming [(name of Servicer)], an Originating Affiliate or a Titled Third-Party Lender (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction) as loss payee and (iii) insuring against loss and damage due to fire, theft, transportation, collision and other risks generally covered by comprehensive and collision coverage. Each Receivable requires the Obligor to maintain physical loss and damage insurance, naming [(name of Servicer)], an Originating Affiliate or a Titled Third-Party Lender (which may be accomplished by the use of a properly registered DBA name in the applicable jurisdiction) and its successors and assigns as additional insured parties, and each Receivable permits the holder thereof to obtain physical loss and damage insurance at the expense of the Obligor if the Obligor fails to do so. No Financed Vehicle is insured under a policy of Force-Placed Insurance on the related Cutoff Date.28. Remaining Principal Balance. At the Cutoff Date the Principal Balance of each Receivable set forth in the Schedule of Receivables is true and accurate in all material respects.29. Certain Characteristics of the Receivables.(a) Each Receivable had a remaining maturity, as of the Cutoff Date, of not less than 3 months and not more than 72 months.(b) Each Receivable had an original maturity, as of the Cutoff Date, of not less than 3 months and not more than 72 months.(c) Each Receivable had a remaining Principal Balance, as of the Cutoff Date, of at least $250 and not more than $85,000.(d) Each Receivable had an Annual Percentage Rate, as of the Cutoff Date, of at least 1% and not more than 33%.(e) No Receivable was more than 30 days past due as of the Cutoff Date.(f) No funds had been advanced by [(name of Servicer)], any Originating Affiliate, any Dealer, any Third-Party Lender, or anyone acting on behalf of any of them in order to cause any Receivable to qualify under clause (e) above.(g) Each Obligor had a billing address in the United States as of the date of origination of the related Receivable, is a natural person and is not an Affiliate of any party to the Basic Documents.(h) Each Receivable is denominated in, and each Contract provides for payment in, United States dollars.(l) Each Receivable is identified on the Servicer's master servicing records as a retail automobile installment sales contract.(j) Each Receivable arose under a Contract that is assignable without the consent of, or notice to, the Obligor thereunder, and does not contain a confidentiality provision that purports to restrict the ability of the Servicer to exercise its rights under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, including, without limitation, its right to review the Contract.(k) Each Receivable arose under a Contract with respect to which [(name of Servicer)] has performed all obligations required to be performed by it thereunder, and, in the event such Contract is an installment sales contract, delivery of the Financed Vehicle to the related Obligor has occurred.(l) No automobile related to a Receivable was held in repossession inventory as of the Cutoff Date.(m) No Obligor was in bankruptcy as of the Cutoff Date.30. No Further Amounts Owed on the Receivables. At the time each Receivable was acquired from an Originating Affiliate, a Dealer or a Third-Party Lender, no further amounts were owed by Seller to the Obligor under the Receivable.31. Interest Calculation. Each Contract provides for the calculation of interest payable thereunder under either the "simple interest" method, the "Rule of 78's" method or the "precomputed interest" method.32. Lockbox Account. Each Obligor has been, or will be, directed to make all payments on their related Receivable to the Lockbox Processor for deposit into the Lockbox Account.33. Transfer. Each Receivable prohibits the sale or transfer of the Financed Vehicle without the consent of the Seller.34. Prepayment. Each Receivable allows for prepayment and partial prepayments without penalty and requires that a prepayment by the related Obligor will fully pay the principal balance and accrued interest through the date of prepayment based on the Receivable's Annual Percentage Rate.35. Lien Enforcement. Each Receivable provides for enforcement of the lien or the clear legal right of repossession, as applicable, on the Financed Vehicle securing such Receivable.36. Prospectus Supplement Description. Each Receivable conforms, and all Receivables in the aggregate conform, in all material respects to the description thereof set forth in the Prospectus Supplement.37. Risk of Loss. Each Contract contains provisions requiring the Obligor to assume all risk of loss or malfunction on the related Financed Vehicle, requiring the Obligor to pay all sales, use, property, excise and other similar taxes imposed on or with respect to the Financed Vehicle and making the Obligor liable for all payments required to be made thereunder, without any setoff, counterclaim or defense for any reason whatsoever, subject only to the Obligor's right of quiet enjoyment.38. Leasing Business. To the best of the Seller's and the Servicer's knowledge, as appropriate, no Obligor is a Person involved in the business of leasing or selling equipment of a type similar to the Obligor's related Financed Vehicle.39. Consumer Leases. No Receivable constitutes a "consumer lease" under either (a) the UCC as in effect in the jurisdiction the law of which governs the Receivable or (b) the Consumer Leasing Act, 15 USC 1667.40. Perfection. The Seller has taken all steps necessary to perfect [(name of Servicer)]'s security interest against the related Obligors in the property securing the Receivables and will take all necessary steps on behalf of the Trust to maintain the Trust's perfection of the security interest created by each Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle.SCHEDULE C. SERVICING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.Note: Applicable Time Periods Will Vary by StateCompliance with state collection laws is required of all [(name of Servicer)] Collection Personnel. Additionally, [(name of Servicer)] has chosen to follow the guidelines of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).The Collection Process[(name of Servicer)] mails each customer a monthly billing statement 16 to 20 days before payment is due.1. All accounts are issued to the Computer Assisted Collection System (CACS) at 5 days delinquent or at such other dates of delinquency as determined by historical payment patterns of the account.2. The CACS segregates accounts into two major groups: loans 5-45 days delinquent and those over 45 days delinquent.3. Loans delinquent up to 45 days are then further segregated into two groups: accounts that have good phone numbers and those that do not.4. Loans up to 45 days delinquent are transferred to ([(name of Servicer)]'s predictive dialing system). The system automatically dials the phone number related to a delinquent account for all accounts that have good phone numbers. When a connection is made, the account is then routed to the next available account representative.5. Loans without good phone numbers are called manually, through the CACS system, or in a preview dialer campaign.6. All reasonable collection efforts are made in an attempt to prevent these accounts from becoming 30+ days delinquent – this includes the use of collection letters. Collection letters may be utilized between 5th and 25th days of delinquency.7. When an account reaches 31 days delinquent, a collector determines if any default notification is required in the state where the debtor lives.8. When an account exceeds 45 days delinquent, the loan is assigned to a 46+ collection team which will continue the collection effort until resolution. If the account cannot be resolved through normal collection efforts (i.e., satisfactory payment arrangements) then the account may be submitted for repossession approval. An officer must approve all repossession requests.9. CACS allows each collector to accurately document and update each customer file when contact (verbal or written) is made.RepossessionsIf repossession of the collateral occurs, the following steps are taken:1. Proper authorities are notified (if applicable).2. An inventory of all personal property is taken and a condition report is prepared on the vehicle.3. Written notification, as required by state law, is sent to the customer(s) stating their rights of redemption or reinstatement along with information on how to obtain any personal property that was in the vehicle at the time of repossession.4. Written request to the originating dealer for all refunds due for dealer adds is made.5. Collateral disposition through public or private sale, (dictated by state law), in a commercially reasonable manner, through a third-party auto auction.6. After the collateral is liquidated, the debtor(s) is notified in writing of the deficiency balance owed, if any.Use of Due Date ChangesDue dates may be changed subject to the following conditions:1. The account is contractually current or will be brought current with the due date change.2. Due date changes cannot exceed the total of 30 days over the life of the contract.3. The first installment payment has been paid in full.4. Only one due date change in a twelve month period.Any exceptions to the above stated policy must be approved by the appropriate level of authority.Use of Payment DefermentsA payment deferral is offered to customers who have the desire and capacity to make future payments but who have encountered temporary financial difficulties.1. A minimum of six payments have been made on the account and a minimum of six payments have been made since the most recent deferment (if any).2. The account will be brought current with the deferment.3. A deferment fee is collected on all transactions.4. No more than eight total payments may be deferred over the life of the loan.Any exceptions to the above stated policy must be approved by the appropriate level of authority.Charge-OffsIt is [(name of Servicer)]'s policy that any account that is not successfully recovered by 120 days delinquent is submitted to an Officer for approval and charge-off.It is [(name of Servicer)]'s policy to carry all Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts until 120 days delinquent. A partial charge-off is taken for the unsecured portion of the account. On fully reaffirmed Chapter 7 bankruptcy accounts, the accounts can be deferred current at the time of discharge.Deficiency CollectionsCollections on charged-off accounts are continued internally and/or assigned to third party collection agencies for deficiency balances.

Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (NJ)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of Attorney   |   Miscellaneous Documents & Client LettersMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in New Jersey. An estate plan is defined as an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during his or her lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of his or her beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, there may be a need for advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, or various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options, including detailed practice notes, templates, and checklists.Initial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for him or her. It is crucial for counsel to ascertain a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice for this information to be sought out prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets; personal information about things like his or her children, citizenship, any prior marriage, etc.; and his or her desired fiduciaries.The following Practical Guidance resource will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, the attorney must consider the proper tools to carry out those objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's kit. A will enables the client to designate how his or her assets should be distributed after death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement pursuant to which a grantor transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and is tasked with administering them but does so only on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts can be classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the grantor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the grantor dies. Note, however, that testamentary trusts are not listed in this section; rather, they are included in some of the will forms listed above. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in his or her estate plan (e.g., avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan will likely include provisions outlining what should take place in the event of a client's disability. An advance directive can be used to authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf. A living will is an advance health care directive that details the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in a variety of potential circumstances. Both instruments serve to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if he or she cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance. In addition, certain clients may benefit from guidance concerning elder law planning.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are often included as part of a client's estate plan. A power of attorney is the legal instrument by which an individual (the principal) authorizes another individual (the attorney-in-fact or agent) to make certain business, financial, and personal decisions on his or her behalf.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information on powers of attorney:Go to table5Miscellaneous Documents & Client LettersDepending on your client's circumstances, a comprehensive estate plan may warrant the preparation of additional documents, such as one detailing the client's wishes for the disposition of their remains, along with various correspondences related to their estate plan. While these are not always included in a standard estate plan, many practitioners incorporate them when they are relevant to the client's situation.The following Practical Guidance resources can be used to supplement a client's estate planning package:Go to table6Current as of: 05/16/2025

Voting Trust Agreement 
This VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT ("Agreement"), made on [date], to become effective as provided herein, between the undersigned persons who presently are shareholders of [company name], a New York corporation, hereinafter called the "Corporation", and [name of trustee] of [trustee's address], New York, [name of trustee] of [trustee's address], New York, and [name of trustee] of [trustee's address], New York, hereinafter called the "Trustees."[Name of shareholder], [name of shareholder] and [name of shareholder] are shareholders of the Corporation, and are hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the "undersigned shareholders."In consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable considerations, it is agreed as follows:1. The undersigned shareholders agree to deposit with the Trustees the shares of common and Class A common shares of the Corporation set forth alongside their respective signatures to this Agreement, endorsed for transfer to the Voting Trustees with appropriate transfer tax stamps affixed, immediately after issuance. The shares shall be surrendered by the Trustees to the Corporation and cancelled, and new certificates shall be issued to and held by the Trustees in the names of "[name of trustee], [name of trustee] and [name of trustee] as VOTING TRUSTEES," subject to the terms of this Agreement. Promptly thereafter, the Trustees shall issue and deliver to the undersigned shareholders Voting Trust Certificates for the shares deposited with the Trustees.2. Voting Trust Certificates to be issued and delivered by the Trustees shall be in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A., the terms of which are incorporated by reference:3. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Trustees shall receive and hold all share dividends and distributions declared and paid on the shares on deposit, and shall issue and deliver Voting Trust Certificates to the shareholders entitled to receive them according to the books of the Trustees. The Trustees shall distribute all other dividends declared and paid on the shares on deposit to the registered holders of Voting Trust Certificates in proportion to their respective interests as shown on the books of the Trustees, so that such distribution is equivalent to the dividend that the respective Voting Trust Certificate holder would have been entitled to receive had he or she not deposited his or her shares under this Agreement.4. In the event of the dissolution or total or partial liquidation of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Trustees shall receive the moneys, securities, rights or property to which the holders of the shares of the Corporation on deposit are entitled, and shall make a distribution among the registered holders of Voting Trust Certificates in proportion to their respective interests as shown on the books of the Trustees, and upon such distribution all further obligations or liability of the Trustees in respect of such moneys, securities, rights or property so received shall cease.5. Any of the Trustees may at any time resign by mailing to the registered holders of the Voting Trust Certificates a written resignation to take effect [number] days thereafter.6. Any Trustee, while acting as Trustee, shall have the right at any time to designate a Successor Trustee to succeed him or her, effective upon such Trustee's resignation by written notice sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Corporation and each of the other Trustees. Each Successor Trustee shall possess the rights, powers and privileges of the resigned Trustee. If the successor named or appointed fails to accept the office of Trustee, or if the resigning Trustee fails to appoint or designate a successor, the remaining Trustees or Trustee shall possess all of the rights, title and powers of the original Voting Trustees.7. The Trustees, acting jointly, shall have the exclusive right to vote the shares on deposit or to give written consents in lieu of voting, subject to any limitation or right to vote contained in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation as amended, or other Certificate filed pursuant to law, in person or by proxy at any meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation, for whatever purpose called and in any proceedings, whether at a meeting of the shareholders or otherwise, where the vote or written consent of shareholders is required or authorized by law.8. Upon the Trustees' receipt of any notice of an offer of any shares or other securities of the Corporation for subscription to the holders of the Corporation's shares on deposit, the Trustees shall promptly mail a copy of the notice to each Voting Trust Certificate holder. Upon the Trustees' receipt, before the last day fixed by the Corporation for subscription and payment, of a written request for subscription from such Voting Trust Certificate holder, accompanied with the sum of money required to subscribe such shares or securities, the Trustees shall make such subscription and payment. Upon the Trustees' receipt from the Corporation of the certificates for shares subscribed for, the Trustees shall issue to the holder a Voting Trust Certificate. However, if the certificate is for securities other than common or Class A common shares, the Trustees shall mail or deliver such securities to the certificate holder in whose behalf the subscription was made.9. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, as amended, provides for the conversion of Class A common into common shares. The Trustees shall deliver to the Corporation, for conversion and cancellation, Class A common shares on the dates on which such conversion shall take place pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and shall direct the Corporation to issue the common shares issued to the Trustees to be held by them subject to the terms of this Agreement. The Voting Trust Certificates issued in respect of the Class A common shares being surrendered for conversion shall be cancelled upon delivery to the Trustees. The Trustees shall contemporaneously issue a new Voting Trust Certificate for the common shares received in exchange for the Class A common shares deposited with the Trustees as evidenced by the Voting Trust Certificate.10.(a) This Agreement shall become effective on the date it is executed, and shall continue in effect for a period of [number] years from such date, subject, however, to the prior termination of this Agreement by the execution and filing with the Corporation of an Agreement of Termination executed by all of the registered holders of Voting Trust Certificates then outstanding and subject to this Agreement. (b) Upon the death of any registered holder of Voting Trust Certificates subject to this Agreement, the Trustees shall cause the shares held by them for the benefit of the deceased holder to be transferred to his or her legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, as the case may be, upon surrender of the voting Trust Certificates registered in the decedent's name endorsed for surrender and cancellation to the Trustees.(c) If any of the Trustees shall have designated a Successor Trustee to succeed himself or herself, effective upon such Trustee's resignation as provided in Paragraph 6. above, the Trustee shall be deemed to have resigned, effective upon the death of the Trustee so designating the Successor Trustee, and the Successor Trustee shall take office upon such resignation.(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate upon the death of any two of the original trustees.11. This Agreement may be renewed for successive [number, e.g., two (2)] year periods or such other term as may be permitted by law, providing the Voting Trust Certificate holders desiring to extend and renew the Agreement give their written consent to each such renewal within six months before each termination date. A copy of each subscribed extension agreement shall be filed with the Corporation. 12. The Trustees shall serve without compensation. The Trustees shall have the right to incur and pay such reasonable expenses and charges and to employ such professional counsel as they deem necessary and proper in the performance of their duties under this Agreement. Any such charges or expenses incurred may be charged pro rata to the holders of Voting Trust Certificates.13. None of the Trustees, their respective Successors nor the Additional Trustees referred to below, shall be liable by reason of any matter or thing in any way arising out of or in relation to this Agreement except for such loss or damage as the Voting Trust Certificate holders may suffer by reason of a Trustee's willful misfeasance or gross negligence. No Trustee acting under this Agreement shall be required to give a bond or other security for the faithful performance of his or her duties.14. Nothing in this Agreement shall disqualify any of the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Additional Trustees from voting for themselves to serve or from serving the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries as officer or Director or in any other capacity and from voting for themselves to receive and receiving compensation for such services.15. Nothing in this Agreement shall disqualify any of the Trustees, Successor Trustees or Additional Trustees from dealing or contracting with the Corporation as a vendor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any transaction or contract be affected or invalidated because any Trustee or any firm or corporation of which any Trustee is a member, shareholder, director or employee, is in any way interested in such transaction or contract. No Trustee shall be liable to account to the Corporation or to any shareholder for any profits realized by, from or through any transaction or contract because such Trustee, or any firm or corporation of which the Trustee is a member, shareholder, director or employee, is interested in such transaction or contract.16. Except in the event of death, none of the undersigned shareholders shall have the right to withdraw any shares on deposit without the prior written consent of the Trustees, or except with the consent in writing of [percentage] of the other certificate holders. If the party desiring to withdraw some or all of his or her shares is also acting as Trustee, he or she shall only be required to obtain the written consent of the other Trustees or Trustee in order to do so.17. The unanimous vote or consent of all of the Trustees shall be necessary for the determination of all questions arising among the Trustees and no action of the Trustees shall be valid or effective except upon such unanimous vote or consent. However, if the Trustees fail to agree unanimously upon any question arising among them, then the matter shall be submitted to the vote of the Trustees and the Additional Trustees or their successors, and the action of [percentage] of the Trustees and the Additional Trustees, voting separately and as one class, shall constitute the action of the Trustees and have the same effect as if assented to by all.[Name of additional trustee], [name of additional trustee] and [name of additional trustee] are designated as Additional Trustees to serve at the pleasure of the Trustees. The Trustees may from time to time, upon their unanimous agreement, designate a person or persons to succeed either or both of the Additional Trustees.18. The words "Voting Trustees" and "Trustees" used in this Agreement mean the Trustees named, the Successor Trustees, or the Additional Trustees or all or some of them where the sense so requires.19. This Agreement expresses the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all negotiations, prior discussions, preliminary agreements, letters of intent and previous agreements, whether written, oral, electronic or otherwise, relating to the subject matter hereunder. This Agreement may not be changed or modified except in writing executed by all Voting Trust Certificate holders.20. Any notice to or communication with the holders of the Voting Trust Certificates shall be deemed sufficiently given or made if addressed to such holders at their respective addresses appearing on the [as applicable, e.g., Transfer Books] of the Trustees. Any notice to the Trustees shall be sent in triplicate, a copy being addressed to each of the Trustees at their respective addresses set forth above.21. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Any action or proceeding relating to, enforcing or interpreting this Agreement shall be brought and maintained exclusively in any proper forum in [county name] County, New York. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR ACTION ARISING FROM THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.22. No waiver of any term or right in this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party or parties. The failure of any party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver or modification of such provision, or impairment of its right to enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement thereafter.23. In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement and this Agreement shall be construed as if said unenforceable or invalid provision had not been contained herein.24. If an action is instituted to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing party or parties in such action shall be entitled to recover from the losing party or parties its or their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs as set by the court.25. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the rights and remedies of the parties herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or equity.26. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (OH)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of Attorney   |   Miscellaneous Documents & Client LettersMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for an individual with a spouse or partner residing in Ohio. An estate plan is defined as an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during his or her lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of his or her beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, there may be a need for advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, or various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options, including detailed practice notes, templates, and checklists.Initial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting.

Certificate of Trust 
KNOW THAT, [Settlor name], having an address at [Settlor address], as Settlor, created a revocable trust, known as the [name of trust] dated [month day, year] by executing a Declaration of Trust, dated [month day, year] naming [trustee name] having an address at [trustee address], as trustee(s) (referred to as the "Trustee"), and [successor trustee 1], having an address at [successor trustee 1 address], and [successor trustee 2], having an address at [successor trustee address 2], as successor trustees (collectively referred to as a "successor Trustee").This Certificate of Trust is executed as evidence of the existence of the foregoing Declaration of Trust. Any person may rely upon this Certificate of Trust as evidence of the existence of said Declaration of Trust, and is relieved of any obligation to verify that any transaction entered into by a Trustee or successor Trustee thereunder is consistent with the terms and conditions of said Declaration of Trust. The Declaration of Trust has not been revoked, amended or modified in any manner that would result in the representations contained in this Certificate of Trust to be false or incorrect. Furthermore, there have been no amendments limiting the powers of the Trustee of said Declaration of Trust.The Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustee shall have all of the powers and authority granted to trustees by statute or common law in any jurisdiction in which the Trustee may act, including, but not limited to, all powers and authorities set forth in Chapter 203E, Section 816 of the Massachusetts General Laws and by any future amendments thereto, except for any instance in which such powers and authorities may conflict with the express provisions of the Declaration of Trust, in which case the express provisions of the Declaration of Trust shall control.

Certificate of Independent Review 
California Probate Code Section 21380 states: (a) A provision of an instrument making a donative transfer to any of the following persons is presumed to be the product of fraud or undue influence:1. The person who drafted the instrument.2. A person who transcribed the instrument or caused it to be transcribed and who was in a fiduciary relationship with the transferor when the instrument was transcribed.3. A care custodian of a transferor who is a dependent adult, but only if the instrument was executed during the period in which the care custodian provided services to the transferor, or within 90 days before or after that period.4. A care custodian who commenced a marriage, cohabitation, or domestic partnership with a transferor who is a dependent adult while providing services to that dependent adult, or within 90 days after those services were last provided to the dependent adult, if the donative transfer occurred, or the instrument was executed, less than six months after the marriage, cohabitation, or domestic partnership commenced.5. A person who is related by blood or affinity, within the third degree, to any person described in paragraphs 1. to 3., inclusive.6. A cohabitant or employee of any person described in paragraphs 1. to 3., inclusive.7. A partner, shareholder, or employee of a law firm in which a person described in paragraph 1. or 2. has an ownership interest.
CERTIFICATE OF INDEPENDENT REVIEWI, [name of attorney], have reviewed [name of instrument] and have counseled my client, [name of client], fully and privately on the nature and legal effect of the designation as trustee of [name of trustee] contained in that instrument. I am so disassociated from the interest of the person named as trustee as to be in a position to advise my client impartially and confidentially as to the consequences of the designation. On the basis of this counsel, I conclude that the designation of a person who would otherwise be subject to removal under paragraph (6) of subdivision (b) of Section 15642 of the Probate Code Section is clearly the settlor's intent and that intent is not the product of fraud or undue influence.____________________________________________(Name of Attorney)____________________________________________(Date)End of Document

Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of AttorneyMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in the District of Columbia. It includes essential estate planning templates that may be used for a variety of clients in the District of Columbia, as well as non-jurisdictional estate planning practice notes, videos, templates, and other practical guidance that can be used to supplement and enhance the District of Columbia-specific resources. When utilizing any non-jurisdictional templates or other guidance, ensure you consult and incorporate the District of Columbia laws and customize the template to meet the specific needs of the individual clients.An estate plan is an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, clients should have advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, and possibly various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options.For a full listing of key clauses for use when drafting certain estate planning documents, including wills and testaments and trusts, see:• Trust Clauses Resource Kit• Will Clauses Resource KitInitial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for the client. It is crucial that you determine a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice to seek this information prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets and personal information, such as, children, citizenship, any prior marriages, the desired fiduciaries, etc.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, you must consider the proper tools to meet these objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's tool kit. A will enables the client to designate how assets should be distributed after the client's death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement where a trustor (also known as a grantor or settlor) transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and administers them on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts are classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the trustor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the trustor dies. Note that testamentary trusts are not listed in this section; rather, they are in some of the will templates listed above. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in their estate plan (e.g., to avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan should include provisions outlining what should take place upon a client's disability. An advance health care directive can authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf and detail the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in certain circumstances. This serves to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if the individual cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are an essential part of a client's estate plan. A power of attorney is the legal instrument by which an individual (the principal) authorizes another individual (the agent) to make certain business, financial, and personal decisions on the principal's behalf.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information on powers of attorney:Go to table5Current as of: 02/25/2025

Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (WI)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of AttorneyMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in Wisconsin. It includes essential estate planning templates that may be used for a variety of clients in Wisconsin, as well as non-jurisdictional estate planning practice notes, videos, templates, and other practical guidance that can be used to supplement and enhance the Wisconsin-specific resources. When utilizing any non-jurisdictional templates or other guidance, ensure you consult and incorporate Wisconsin laws and customize the template to meet the specific needs of the individual clients.An estate plan is an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, clients should have advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, and possibly various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options.For a full listing of key clauses for use when drafting certain estate planning documents, including wills and testaments and trusts, see:• Trust Clauses Resource Kit• Will Clauses Resource KitInitial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for the client. It is crucial that you determine a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice to seek this information prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets and personal information, such as, children, citizenship, any prior marriages, the desired fiduciaries, etc.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, you must consider the proper tools to meet these objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's tool kit. A will enables the client to designate how assets should be distributed after the client's death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement where a trustor (also known as a grantor or settlor) transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and administers them on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts are classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the trustor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the trustor dies. Note that testamentary trusts are not listed in this section; rather, they are in some of the will templates listed above. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in their estate plan (e.g., to avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan should include provisions outlining what should take place upon a client's disability. An advance health care directive can authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf and detail the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in certain circumstances. This serves to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if the individual cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are an essential part of a client's estate plan.

Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of AttorneyMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in Alabama. It includes essential estate planning templates that may be used for a variety of clients in Alabama, as well as non-jurisdictional estate planning practice notes, videos, templates, and other practical guidance that can be used to supplement and enhance the Alabama-specific resources. When utilizing any non-jurisdictional templates or other guidance, ensure you consult and incorporate Alabama laws and customize the template to meet the specific needs of the individual clients.An estate plan is an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, clients should have advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, and possibly various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options.For a full listing of key clauses for use when drafting certain estate planning documents, including wills and testaments and trusts, see:• Trust Clauses Resource Kit• Will Clauses Resource KitInitial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for the client. It is crucial that you determine a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice to seek this information prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets and personal information, such as, children, citizenship, any prior marriages, the desired fiduciaries, etc.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, you must consider the proper tools to meet these objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's tool kit. A will enables the client to designate how assets should be distributed after the client's death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement where a trustor (also known as a grantor or settlor) transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and administers them on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts are classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the trustor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the trustor dies. Note that testamentary trusts are not listed in this section; rather, they are in some of the will templates listed above. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in their estate plan (e.g., to avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan should include provisions outlining what should take place upon a client's disability. An advance health care directive can authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf and detail the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in certain circumstances. This serves to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if the individual cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are an essential part of a client's estate plan.

Revocable Trust for Single Individual 
Table of Contents
[NAME OF TRUST] REVOCABLE TRUSTI, [name of settlor], residing in [city], Connecticut, ("the Settlor") enter into this Trust Agreement on this [day] day of [month], [year], with the said [name of trustee] ("the Trustee").W I T N E S S E T H:WHEREAS, the Settlor desires to establish this trust, the "[name of trust (e.g., settlor's name)] Revocable Trust" (the "Trust"), for [his/her/their] benefit and protection in the event of [his/her/their] incapacity, and to provide for the disposition of property on [his/her/their] death to the individuals designated below; WHEREAS, the Settlor transfers to the Trustee the property listed in Schedule A. (the "Trust Estate"), and may transfer additional property thereto from time to time, either during the Settlor's life, or pursuant to beneficiary designation or otherwise on the Settlor's death, to be held and administered by the Trustee pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Trust Agreement;WHEREAS, the Trustee agrees to accept this Trust Agreement and to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof;WHEREAS, reference herein to "the Trustees" shall be deemed a reference to all those serving as Trustee or Co-Trustees at any given time, and reference to "a Trustee" shall be to any of the then serving Trustees;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:1. Family Information. The Settlor is unmarried.2. Trust During Settlor's Life. (a) During the Settlor's life, the Trustee shall hold, manage, invest, and reinvest the Trust Estate, and shall collect the income thereof, and shall pay so much of the net income and principal to the Settlor, or apply for the Settlor's benefit, as the Trustee shall determine in Trustee's absolute discretion. The Trustee shall accumulate any undistributed income and add the same to the principal of the Trust.(b) The Trustee shall liberally distribute income and principal of the Trust for the Settlor's benefit. The rights of the successor beneficiaries hereunder shall be considered secondary. The Trust is established to ensure that the best available care and support is provided to the Settlor to meet all the Settlor's lifetime needs. All assets of the Trust are to be considered available for that purpose, and the Trustee shall at all times be guided by that purpose and intent. While the Settlor is acting as Trustee, [he/she/they] may act individually and without oversight from any successor Trustees.(c) If the Settlor is not the serving Trustee during the Settlor's lifetime, the then acting Trustee shall make every effort to involve the Settlor in decision-making regarding both financial matters and personal care. The Trustee shall make every effort to determine the Settlor's wishes and make decisions that conform to them. If the Settlor is unable to make [his/her/their] wishes known, the Trustee shall make decisions that the Trustee believes that the Settlor would make, bearing in mind that the least restrictive alternatives for living arrangements are desirable so that the Settlor may live with the greatest degree of dignity possible. The Trust is to be used to provide the Settlor with the best available care and support during the Settlor's lifetime.3. Distributions on Settlor's Death. Upon the Settlor's death:(a) The Trustee shall pay to or on behalf of the Settlor's estate, such amounts as may be requested from the executor of the Settlor's estate, for the payment of the Settlor's debts, funeral expenses, and expenses of the Settlor's last illness. Additionally, the Trustee shall pay to or on behalf of the Settlor's estate, such expenses of administering the Trust Estate, including the costs of safeguarding and delivering assets. The Trustee shall pay any federal and state estate tax that may be due by reason of the Settlor's death, as further provided in Section 4. below, unless the Trustee, in the Trustee's discretion, determines that other adequate provisions have been made for payment of those expenses and taxes. Such payments may be made directly to the taxing authorities or other persons entitled thereto or to the executors of the Settlor's estate. The Trustee shall have no duty or obligation to determine the correctness, validity, propriety, or amount of any such taxes or expenses or to see to the proper use or disposition of any such payment. The Trustee shall have no liability for any such payment made in good faith or pursuant to the request or instructions of the executors of the Settlor's estate. Any decision made by the Trustee as to the amount and manner of any payments authorized or directed to be made by this Section shall fully protect the Trustee and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons interested in the Trust.(b) The Trustee shall distribute all of the tangible personal property held or received by the Trustee at the time of the Settlor's death, as follows:(i) If the Settlor's Will or any written statement prepared by the Settlor, specifically bequeaths any tangible personal property which, at the time of the Settlor's death, is held in trust hereunder, the Trustee shall distribute such property as provided under the Will or written statement.(ii) The balance of such tangible personal property shall be divided among the Settlor's children who survive the Settlor, to be divided among them as they shall agree. If the Settlor's children cannot reach an agreement with respect to the disposition of such property within 90 days after the Settlor's death, or if any such child is then a minor or otherwise under a legal disability, then such property shall be divided by the Trustee in as nearly equal shares as practical, having due regard for their personal preferences. The Trustee may sell any of such property for which the Settlor's children do not indicate a preference and, in such case, shall distribute the proceeds as part of the Settlor's Residuary Trust Estate.(iii) Each beneficiary of tangible personal property under this section shall be entitled to any claims in the Settlor's favor existing at the Settlor's death with respect to the property distributed to such beneficiary, and, to the extent practical, shall be entitled to any insurance policies relating to such tangible personal property.(iv) The term "tangible personal property" shall include, but not be limited to, the Settlor's household goods, jewelry, furniture, furnishings, equipment, and automobiles, together with all insurance policies relating thereto, but such term does not include personally held art, antiques, stamp and coin collections, and other collectibles. Such term also does not include property primarily held for investment purposes, nor does it include any property held for use in a trade or business, ordinary currency and cash, or bullion.(v) If any child entitled to receive a share of tangible personal property under this Section is a minor, the Trustee, in the exercise of the Trustee's discretion, may:(A) Sell all or any part of such minor child's share of tangible personal property and hold the proceeds from such sale for such minor child in their separate trust;(B) Keep possession and control over all or any part of such tangible personal property which is not sold until such child attains the age of majority; or(C) Deliver such tangible personal property to such child, to such child's parent or other adult with whom such minor resides, to such child's duly appointed guardian, or to a custodian for such child (including a Trustee hereunder) under the applicable Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act of any jurisdiction. The receipt of such property by such child, parent, adult with whom such minor child resides, guardian, or custodian shall fully discharge the Trustee with respect to such delivery.(vi) Any costs of distribution of any tangible personal property, including, without limitation, storage, insurance, packing, and delivery, shall be paid by the Trustee as an administrative expense.(c) The balance of the Trust Estate, after the payment of any debts (other than debts secured by mortgages on real estate or loans on life insurance policies), expenses, and taxes, including any property mentioned above but not effectively disposed of ("Residuary Trust Estate"), shall be distributed to the Settlor's surviving issue, per stirpes, outright and free of any trusts.(d) If at any time there are no persons designated in this Trust Agreement to whom any part of the income or principal may be distributed pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3., such property shall be transferred and paid over to the persons to whom and in the shares and proportions in which the Settlor's administrator would have been required to pay the same under the laws of Connecticut in effect at the time such disposition is made had the Settlor then died intestate and possessed of such property.4. Payment of Death Taxes. All estate, inheritance, legacy, succession, generation-skipping, or other wealth transfer taxes (other than any additional estate tax imposed by Code Sections 2031(c)(5)(C), 2032A(c), or 2057(f), or any generation-skipping transfer tax on any generation-skipping transfer other than a direct skip or any comparable tax imposed by any other taxing authority) that result from the Settlor's death and that are imposed by any domestic or foreign taxing authority as a result of the Settlor's death, but only to the extent imposed upon property passing under the Settlor's Will or this Trust Agreement, together with interest and penalties on those taxes, shall be charged against and paid without apportionment out of the Settlor's Residuary Trust Estate as an administrative expense. Such taxes on property not passing under this Trust Agreement or the Settlor's Will shall be apportioned to and paid by those succeeding to such property in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and any provisions of other applicable law apportioning such taxes. Despite the foregoing, if a personal representative of the Settlor's probate estate is appointed within six months after the Settlor's death, then the Trustee shall pay the preceding items only to the extent the Settlor's personal representative shall certify in writing to the Trustee that the value of the cash and readily marketable assets of the Settlor's residuary estate, as determined by [his/her/their] personal representative, is insufficient to pay those items. Any of the preceding items payable by the Trustee as a result of such certification may be paid either directly to the appropriate payee or to the personal representative of the Settlor's probate estate, as the Trustee determines to be advisable. The preceding items shall be charged generally against the principal of the Residuary Trust Estate. The Trustee shall not seek reimbursement for, recovery of, or contribution toward the payment of the preceding items from any person, except that if no personal representative of the Settlor's probate estate is appointed within six months after the Settlor's death, then, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Trustee shall seek reimbursement for, recovery of, or contribution toward the payment of estate taxes attributable to property which is included in the Settlor's gross estate under Section 2036, 2041, or 2044 of the Code, and which taxes are not otherwise paid or payable. Any generation-skipping tax resulting from a transfer occurring under this Trust Agreement shall be charged to the property constituting the transfer in the manner provided by applicable law.5. Trustee Provisions. (a) Until the death of the Settlor, the Settlor may, at any time by a written instrument signed and acknowledged by the Settlor, appoint one or more co-Trustees to serve with the Settlor and/or appoint one or more successor Trustees to serve in the event a Trustee resigns or otherwise ceases to serve hereunder, and any co-Trustee or successor Trustee so appointed may be removed by the Settlor at any time upon 30 days' written notice to such Trustee. If the Settlor or any co-Trustee or successor Trustee appointed by the Settlor resigns, is removed, or otherwise ceases to serve and there is no other Trustee then serving, [name of successor trustee] shall become Trustee. If [name of successor trustee] fails to qualify or ceases to serve, [name of second successor trustee] shall become Trustee.(b) Upon any Trustee's lack of capacity to manage property, such Trustee shall cease to serve as a Trustee hereunder. Each individual who signs this Trust Agreement or an acceptance of trusteeship hereunder, by so signing:(i) Agrees to cooperate in any physical or mental examination necessary to carry out the provisions of this subsection(ii) Waives all provisions of law relating to disclosure of confidential medical information, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, insofar as that disclosure would be pertinent to any inquiry under this section –and–(iii) Agrees that the obligations under this subsection shall be specifically enforceable.(c) The last acting sole Trustee for whom there is no named successor, whether named in this Trust Agreement or named pursuant to procedures prescribed in this Trust Agreement for the selection of successors, may designate an individual or an institution with fiduciary trust powers as successor Trustee, to succeed such individual sole Trustee in the event that such individual shall cease to act as Trustee for any reason whatsoever. Any such designation shall be made by an instrument in writing, executed, and acknowledged by such designator during their lifetime (which they may alter from time to time), or by their Last Will and Testament duly admitted to probate.(d) In the event of a complete vacancy in the office of Trustee of any trust under this Trust Agreement or the receipt of a notice of resignation from any Trustee such that a complete vacancy would result, then the oldest beneficiary to whom current trust income shall or may then be distributed, or the natural or legal guardians of such beneficiary, shall have the power to appoint an individual or institution with fiduciary trust powers as Trustee of such trust.(e) The Trustee shall adhere to the limitations imposed on the Trustees in Section 8.(f) No Trustee shall be required to give any bond or other security for the proper discharge of the Trustee's duties as a Trustee hereunder in the Connecticut or elsewhere. No Trustee shall be liable for any error in judgment or be liable for good faith reliance on advice of counsel.(g) All Trustees shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for the duties performed in accordance with this Trust Agreement. Reasonable compensation for an individual Trustee is such fees as, from time to time, are recognized in the area as ordinary and reasonable for the service performed. Reasonable compensation for a bank or trust company shall be in accordance with its published fee schedule in effect at the time the services for which the fee is charged are performed, and if no such fee schedule is in effect, such fees as, from time to time, are recognized in the area as ordinary and reasonable for the service performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a corporate trustee shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with its published fee schedule in effect at the time services were rendered.(h) Any Trustee may resign as a Trustee hereunder without prior approval of any court, by delivering to each other Trustee, as the case may be, and to each and every adult beneficiary, a written notice of such resignation. Such resignation shall take effect upon the date stated in the notice, whereupon all duties of the resigning Trustee shall cease, other than the duty to account; a determination that an individual Trustee is incompetent shall be deemed a resignation, by said Trustee, as of the date of that determination.6. Trustee Powers. The Trustee shall have, in addition to the powers conferred by The Connecticut Fiduciary Powers Act (Conn. Gen. Stat. § 45a-234 et seq.), which is hereby incorporated by reference, in Trustee's absolute and uncontrolled discretion, the following rights, powers, and authority, subject only to express provisions to the contrary contained in this Trust Agreement, namely:(a) To receive additional property from any source and to add it and mingle it with any trust created hereunder;(b) To invest and reinvest the principal of the Trust in stocks, common, preferred, or any other class, in bonds, secured or unsecured, and in other securities, in foreign exchange, in mutual funds, in common trust funds, in commodities, equities, mortgages (including mortgages on any property owned by any income beneficiary hereunder), real estate, business enterprises, mineral rights, mine projects, investments in the nature of loans, or other properties of any kind, whether foreign or domestic without regard to the proportion which such property or property of a similar character so held may bear to the entire trust and whether or not such stocks, bonds, securities, or other properties are of the nature approved for fiduciaries by the present or future laws or statutes applicable thereto; accordingly, the Trustee may, but need not, favor retention of assets originally owned by the Settlor prior to contribution to this Trust, and the Trustee shall not be under any duty to diversify investments, regardless of any rule of law requiring diversification, and any such duty is hereby waived; the Trustee may retain and acquire property that does not produce income, subject to any restrictions or qualifications of this power set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement;(c) To hold a part or all of the Trust in cash for a reasonable period of time; to purchase and hold for periods of time non-income producing securities and other property upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee may determine; to take out and maintain life insurance and health insurance policies on any income beneficiary or the spouse or issue of any income beneficiary hereunder and life insurance policies on the Settlor's life;(d) To purchase, sell, exchange, lease, mortgage, grant options upon, abandon, demolish, alter, repair in an ordinary or extraordinary manner, to sell, purchase, and exercise rights and options, or otherwise deal with any real or personal property in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee shall deem proper to make, execute, and deliver all proper instruments for said purposes; any lease made by the Trustee may extend beyond the period fixed by statute for leases made by fiduciaries and beyond the duration of any Trust;(e) To partition, without sale, any real or personal property held jointly or in common with others or distributable to one or more persons hereunder and to pay or receive consideration to effect equality of partition; to unite with any other owner in the management, leasing, use, or improvement of any property;(f) To amortize or not amortize premiums; to create reserves for depreciation and obsolescence, or wasting assets; to allocate receipts and disbursements between income and principal, notwithstanding that such allocations may contravene law or custom which would otherwise be applicable, so long as such allocation is, in its discretion, not unreasonable;(g) To borrow money from anyone, including a Trustee, for any purpose, in connection with the administration of the Settlor's estate, and to assign as collateral security therefor any property forming a part of the Trust; to continue any existing loans, to renew or modify any existing contracts or agreements entered into by the Settlor during the Settlor's life, and to continue any business in which the Settlor was a stockholder, partner, or proprietor at the time of the Settlor's death;(h) To compromise any and all claims, debts, accounts, and causes of action in favor of or against the Trust and to give receipts and acquittances therefor;(i) To retain accountants, agents, attorneys, investment advisors (except in the case of a corporate fiduciary), and such other persons as the Trustee may deem advisable in the administration of the Trust and to make such payments therefor as the Trustee may deem reasonable, whether on an annual retainer basis or otherwise, and to delegate to such person any discretion which the Trustee may deem proper, including by way of illustration and not limitation, discretion delegated to an investment advisor to make purchase and sales with prior consultation; the fact that the Trustee shall be retained in such other capacity shall in no way affect a Trustee's right to receive reasonable compensation for a Trustee's services in such other capacity in addition to a Trustee's reasonable compensation for acting as Trustee;(j) To enter into pooling arrangements and voting trust agreements; to participate in reorganizations; to grant proxies, to deposit property with protective committees; to register securities in the names of nominees, insofar as permitted by law; to participate as a limited partner in private investment partnerships, notwithstanding that said participation may be irrevocable for a period of up to one year, and notwithstanding that under the partnership agreement, limited partners may have no voice in the investment of partnership assets;(k) Out of the proceeds of any insurance policies, pension plan, profit sharing plan, or individual retirement account death benefits held hereunder, the Trustee may, in the Trustee's sole and absolute discretion, purchase assets from the Settlor's estate or loan assets to the Settlor's estate at their fair market value. The propriety of the purchase, the nature and amount of the assets so purchased, and the ascertainment of fair value shall be solely within the discretion of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall incur no liability as a result of such purchase or purchases even though such assets are not investments in which the Trustee is authorized by law or by any rule of court to invest trust funds;(l) Without limitation by specification of the following, the Trustee is expressly authorized and empowered, without any charge of self-dealing and without any increase or decrease in its responsibility and liability, to exercise any and all of the powers, authorities, and discretions provided hereunder in respect of any securities issued by a corporation or in respect of any other business interest in which the Trustee, as a stockholder, officer, director, partner, employee, or otherwise, has a financial interest, and in respect of any securities issued by a corporate executor and the Trustee or a corporation of which a corporate executor and the Trustee is a subsidiary;(m) To make distribution of the Trust in kind and to cause any share to be composed of cash, property, or undivided fractional shares in property different in kind from any other shares and for that purpose to determine the values thereof, so far as permitted by law and by other provisions of this Trust; to determine that any property is worthless or of insufficient value to warrant keeping or protecting and to abandon any such property or to convey the same with or without consideration;(n) To invest the assets of multiple trusts in a single fund if the interests of the trusts are accounted for separately;(o) To merge any trust created hereunder with any other trust or trusts created by the Settlor, if any, under will or deed (if the terms of any such trust are then substantially similar and held for the primary benefit of the same persons);(p) After the Settlor's death, to make voluntary contributions of funds held in this Trust in its discretion to any other trust of the Settlor, if any, under will or deed, either on its own initiative or at the request of any trustee of such other trust; provided, however, in no event is the Trustee under any legal or other obligation to initiate such contribution or to comply with any request that may be made;(q) All rights, powers and duties, discretionary or otherwise, herein conferred upon Trustee shall continue after termination of any trust created hereunder and until complete distribution thereof;(r) To allocate any portion of the Settlor's exemption under Section 2631(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to any property as to which the Settlor is the transferor, including any property transferred by the Settlor during life as to which the Settlor did not make an allocation prior to [his/her/their] death;(s) To divide property in any trust being held hereunder with an inclusion ratio, as defined in Section 2642(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, of neither one hundred percent (100%) nor zero into two separate trusts representing two fractional shares of the property being divided, one to have an inclusion ratio of one hundred percent (100%) and the other to have an inclusion ratio of zero;(t) To make all tax elections and allocations the Trustee may consider appropriate, including any election to treat this revocable trust as part of the Settlor's estate for income tax purposes, even though a Trustee may have an interest affected by the election, except where a Trustee is prohibited from participating in the election by another provision of this Trust Agreement; provided, however, this authority is exercisable only in a fiduciary capacity and may not be used to enlarge or shift any beneficial interest except as an incidental consequence of the discharge of fiduciary duties. Tax elections and allocations made in good faith shall not require equitable adjustments;(u) To exercise in person or by general or limited proxy all voting and other rights, powers, and privileges and to take all steps to realize all benefits with respect to stocks or other securities; and to enter into or oppose, alone or with others, voting trusts, mergers, consolidations, foreclosures, liquidations, reorganizations, or other changes in the financial structure of any corporation;(v) To elect, pursuant to the terms of any employee benefit plan, individual retirement plan, or insurance contract, the mode of distribution of the proceeds thereof, and no adjustment shall be made in the interests of the beneficiaries to compensate for the effect of the election; and(w) With respect to the Settlor's digital assets, the Trustee may:(i) Access, use, and control the Settlor's digital devices, including, but not limited to, desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, peripheral storage devices, mobile telephones, smart phones, and any similar digital device which currently exists or may exist as technology develops or such comparable items as technology develops with the purpose of accessing, modifying, deleting, controlling, or transferring the Settlor's digital assets.(ii) Access, modify, delete, control, and transfer the Settlor's digital assets, including, but not limited to, any and all of the Settlor's emails, email accounts, digital music, digital photographs, digital videos, hotel points, airline miles, software licenses, social network accounts, file-sharing accounts, financial accounts, domain registrations, DNS service accounts, web hosting accounts, tax preparation service accounts, online store accounts, affiliate programs, other online accounts, and similar digital items which currently exist or may exist as technology develops or such comparable items as technology develops.(iii) Access any of the Settlor's electronically stored information.(iv) Access the content of any communication that has been electronically stored by the service provider for that communication or that is carried or maintained by the service provider for that communication.(v) Access any record or other information pertaining to the Settlor with respect to that service.The terms used in this authorization are to be construed as broadly as possible and that this authorization of access be construed as the Settlor's lawful consent under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended; the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, as amended; and any other applicable Federal or state data privacy law or criminal law.7. Trust Administration. In the administration of any trust created hereunder:(a) Any instrument executed by the Trustee shall bind all parties interested in the Trust, including the Trust beneficiaries. No person, including any insurance company and any trustee of a retirement benefit plan, transferring property or funds to the Trustee shall be required to see to the application of such property or funds.(b) The Trustee may release any power, authority, or discretion conferred upon the Trustee by the provisions of this Trust Agreement or by law, by filing a written disclaimer with the beneficiaries of the Trust.(c) The Trustee shall not be liable for any act performed by them in good faith or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law, save only for their individual acts of willful misconduct, and shall be fully protected in any course of conduct taken in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.(d) A successor Trustee shall not be personally liable for any act or omission of any predecessor Trustee. Any successor Trustee acting under this Trust Agreement may accept the Trust assets delivered to them by or on behalf of the predecessor Trustee as constituting the entire Trust Estate, and the successor Trustee shall not be required to take any action to recover further assets or to investigate any acts done by any predecessor Trustee, nor shall any successor Trustee be required to bring any action to determine what constitutes the Trust Estate or to obtain possession thereof. A successor Trustee may continue to hold assets received from the predecessor Trustee in the same manner as though the assets had been originally deposited with the successor under this Trust Agreement.(e) Until the Trustee receives written notice of any death or other event upon which the right to payments from any trust hereunder may depend, the Trustee shall incur no liability for disbursements made in good faith to persons whose interests may have been affected by that event. Any notices or other communication required or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be delivered to or served on the Trustees shall be deemed received by the Trustee when personally delivered to the Trustee, or, in lieu of such personal delivery, when deposited in the United States mail, certified mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the Trustee at their business or personal address.(f) Any person may rely on a copy or portion of this Trust Agreement certified by a notary public or commissioner of the superior court to be a true copy or portion of this Trust Agreement. Anyone may rely on any statement of fact certified by anyone who appears from the original copy or portion of the Trust Agreement or a certified copy or portion thereof to be a Trustee hereunder.(g) Annually and upon termination of any of the trusts established hereunder, the Trustee shall render an accounting setting forth the receipts and disbursements of principal and income and the assets on hand at the commencement and expiration of the accounting period. The written approval of such accounting by the Settlor during [his/her/their] lifetime, or by the then living competent adult beneficiaries hereunder after the Settlor's death, shall be final and binding upon all who are then or may thereafter become entitled to any part of the assets, as to all matters and transactions shown in the account, notwithstanding that an approving beneficiary may also be a Trustee hereunder. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Trustee from submitting an account to a court for settlement.(h) If all or any part of any trust assets are distributable outright to a minor, the Trustee may, in the Trustee's discretion, pay over and distribute the property belonging to such minor to such minor's parent, guardian, or other qualified person as custodian under the applicable Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act of any jurisdiction. Alternatively, the Trustee may continue to hold the property for such minor and make expenditures directly for the care, support, maintenance, or education of the minor beneficiary.(i) If, pursuant to the provisions of this Trust Agreement, disposition of property is made conditional upon a beneficiary surviving another person and there is an alternate disposition if the beneficiary fails to survive, that alternate disposition shall govern if the beneficiary and that other person die under such circumstances that there is no sufficient evidence that they died otherwise than simultaneously.(j) No beneficiary of the Trust shall have any right or power to anticipate, pledge, assign, sell, transfer, alienate or encumber in any way such beneficiary's interest in the income of the trust or such beneficiary's interest in the principal of the trust receivable in the future. No interest of any beneficiary shall be subject to any claims of the Beneficiary's creditors or liable to attachment, execution, or other process of law.(k) All benefits granted to a beneficiary under this Trust Agreement shall be the separate property of such beneficiary (as distinguished from marital property, community property, quasi-community property, or any other form of property as to which such beneficiary's spouse might have a claim or interest arising out of the marital relationship under the law of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign). All benefits granted to a beneficiary hereunder shall also be free of any interference from, or control or marital power of, their spouse. For purposes of this subsection, the term "benefits" shall include real or personal property, tangible or intangible, and the provisions of this subsection shall apply not only to benefits actually paid to any beneficiary but also to trust property allocated to a trust in which the beneficiary possesses an interest hereunder.(l) The fact that a Trustee is active in the investment business shall not be deemed a conflict of interest, and purchases and sales of investments may be made through a corporate Trustee or through any firm of which a corporate or individual Trustee is a partner, member, shareholder, proprietor, associate, employee, owner, subsidiary, affiliate, or the like. Property of a trust hereunder may be invested in individual securities, mutual funds, partnerships, private placements, or other forms of investment promoted, underwritten, managed, or advised by a Trustee or such a firm.(m) In making any allocations or distributions to any beneficiary, the Trustee may make such allocations or distributions wholly in kind or in money, or partly in kind and partly in money, and may allocate and/or distribute different property interests to distributees and may do so without making pro rata allocations or distributions of specific assets; and the choice, relative values and relative federal income tax bases of the property or money so divided, allocated, or distributed shall, in the absence of fraud or bad faith, be binding and conclusive on everyone interested therein; and they shall in no event be accountable for any error of judgment or discretion in exercising the power and authority herein conferred.(n) The title, powers, duties, immunities, and discretion herein conferred upon the Trustee shall continue after the termination of the trust until final distribution.(o) Subject to the limitations described in Section 8., and the authority to delegate powers in subsection (p) below, in circumstances where the Trustee is more than one individual or entity (or one of each), then the Trustee shall exercise and perform every power (including discretionary powers), authority, or duty only by the unanimous vote of all individuals and entities serving as the Trustee.(p) Subject to the limitations described in Section 8., any individual or entity serving as a Trustee may, by a signed instrument, and with the consent of any other individual or entity serving as a Trustee, delegate to that other Trustee, all or any portion of the powers, discretions, and duties vested in Trustee by this Trust Agreement or by law, including any power, discretion, or duty which would not, absent this section, be delegable; provided, however, that this section shall not be construed to permit any power, discretion or duty to be delegated to a Trustee who is expressly foreclosed from participating in the exercise of such power, discretion, or duty pursuant to any provision under this Trust Agreement, including but not limited to those described in Section 8., or to permit the delegation of any power discretion or duty specifically reserved to a particular Trustee.(q) The situs of the Trust shall be Connecticut. In the sole and absolute discretion of the Trustee, the location of the situs of the Trust may be transferred to such other jurisdiction as to provide for ease of administration and minimization of taxation. Upon any such transfer of situs, the Trust may thereafter, at the election of the Trustees, be administered exclusively under the laws of (and subject, as required, to the exclusive supervision of the courts of) the jurisdiction to which it has been transferred. Accordingly, if the Trustee of any trust created hereunder elect to change the situs of any such trust, said Trustee is hereby relieved of any requirement of having to qualify in any other jurisdiction and of any requirement of having to account in any court of such other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the above, no Trustee with a beneficial interest in the Trust shall participate in any action described above.(r) The Trustee (other than any Trustee who has a beneficial interest in the trust) may, by an instrument in writing, amend the administrative provisions (including without limitation amendments to minimize taxes, protect assets from a beneficiary's creditors and establish a beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits) of any trust created hereunder in any manner the Trustee determines in its discretion will help achieve the Settlor's planning goals. The determination of the Trustee as to whether a provision is administrative, and identification of the Settlor's planning goals, shall be conclusive as to all beneficiaries. No amendment under this Section may increase the class of beneficiaries or give any beneficial interest or economic benefit in any trust to any person not already a beneficiary of this Trust.(s) Distributions that the Trustee elects for tax purposes to treat as having been made on the last day of the preceding tax year shall be similarly treated for trust accounting purposes. Subject to such tax election, undistributed income of a trust which is not required to distribute all of its income currently may be allocated to principal from time to time and if it is not so allocated during the year, shall be added to principal as of the end of each year;(t) The trusts created hereunder shall be perpetual to the fullest extent permitted by governing law. If the Trust created hereunder is deemed to be subject to the law of a jurisdiction that has a rule against perpetuities or similar rule which limits the period during which property may lawfully be held in trust, or if it shall become necessary to subject ay such separate trust to a rule against perpetuities in order to preserve such trust's treatment under the federal generation-skipping transfer tax, then such trust shall terminate at the end of the longest period of time under which such assets can be held in trust in such jurisdiction. Upon the termination of the trust, the Trustee shall distribute the then remaining Trust Estate to the primary beneficiary, if then living, otherwise per stirpes to the primary beneficiary's then living descendants, or if none, per stirpes, to the then living descendants of the primary beneficiary's most immediate ancestor who is a descendant of the Settlor and who has one or more descendants living, or if none, per stirpes, to the Settlor's then living descendants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, no power of appointment shall be exercised so as to violate any rule against perpetuities.(u) Whenever the Trustee, in the Trustee's discretion, shall determine that it is uneconomic to continue any trust with respect to which such Trustee is acting hereunder, the Trustee, without the permission or order of any court, may terminate the trust. Upon such termination, the entire balance remaining shall be paid over to the beneficiaries entitled to the income thereof at that time, in the proportions in which they are beneficiaries of such income. If any such beneficiary is a minor, payment of any such minor's share may be made to such minor, or to a guardian of the property of such minor wherever appointed without requiring ancillary guardianship, or to any qualified custodian under the applicable Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act of any jurisdiction with power to select any person or trust company (including any Trustee hereunder) to be such custodian. The Trustee shall have no obligation to see to the use or application thereon, and the receipt of such minor, guardian, parent, person, or custodian shall be a complete discharge as to such transfer or payment. In deciding whether to terminate such trust, the Trustee need not consider the interest of remaindermen or succeeding income beneficiaries, and their respective interests in the trust share in question shall cease upon termination by the Trustee. If at the time in question, any Trustee then serving is a beneficiary of the trust share in question, or if any Trustee who is a related or subordinate party, as defined under Section 672(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, was appointed by the beneficiary of the trust share in question, such Trustee may not take part in deciding whether or not to terminate the trust share in question unless the principal of such trust does not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00).8. Limitation on Powers. Notwithstanding any provision of this Trust Agreement to the contrary, the following shall apply:(a) With respect to distributions from any trust by a Trustee:(i) No Trustee shall have the power to make discretionary distributions of either principal or income to or for the benefit of the Trustee, the Trustee's estate, or the creditors of either, provided, however, that a Trustee who is otherwise permitted to make distributions to himself or herself subject to an ascertainable standard for Federal tax purposes under Code Sec. 2041(b) may exercise such power, unless such power would cause the trust property to be subject to the claims of such Trustee's creditors.(ii) No Trustee shall have the power to make discretionary distributions of either principal or income to satisfy any of the trustee's personal legal obligations for support or other purposes.(iii) No Trustee shall have the power to make discretionary allocations in the Trustee's personal favor of receipts or expenses as between income and principal, unless such Trustee has no power to enlarge or shift any beneficial interest except as an incidental consequence of the discharge of such Trustee's fiduciary duties.(iv) No Trustee shall have the power to exercise any of the powers proscribed by this Section 8.(a) with regard to an individual, other than the Trustee, to the extent that such individual could exercise a similar prohibited power in connection with a trust that benefits the Trustee.(b) If any trust created under this Trust Agreement contains a power proscribed under Section 8.(a), the power may be exercised by the remaining individuals and/or entities serving as the Trustee who are not so prohibited as if they were the only Trustee. Accordingly, it is the Settlor's intent that any beneficiary serving as Trustee shall not participate in the discretionary distribution of any income or principal to that Trustee as a beneficiary. If there is no Trustee in office who can exercise such power, then subject to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign as Trustee and another Trustee shall be appointed pursuant to this Trust Agreement, to exercise such proscribed power.(c) No beneficiary of a trust, in an individual, trustee, or other capacity, may appoint, or remove and appoint, a trustee who is related or subordinate to the beneficiary within the meaning of Code Section 672(c).(d) No Trustee shall have any power, incident of ownership, or right of any kind relating to any life insurance policy on their life held as part of any trust with respect to which they are acting as one of the Trustees.(e) No holder of any special power of appointment shall have any power to appoint any property to the extent that such appointment would satisfy any legal obligations of support of such powerholder.(f) The limitations imposed on Trustees by this Section shall not apply to the Settlor to the extent the Trust is revocable and therefore included in the Settlor's taxable estate for estate tax purposes.9. Interpretation and Construction. (a) This Trust is revocable. The Settlor expressly reserves the right, by signed instruments duly acknowledged and delivered to the Trustee during the Settlor's life, to withdraw property from this trust in any amount and at any time; add other property to the Trust; alter or amend all or any part of the provisions of this Trust Agreement; and revoke this Trust Agreement in its entirety or any provision or amendment therein. These powers are personal in nature and may not be exercised on the Settlor's behalf by the Settlor's duly appointed attorney-in-fact or agent.(b) Should any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement be for any reason invalid, the invalidity thereof shall not affect any of the other provisions hereunder, and all invalid provisions hereof shall be wholly disregarded.(c) Where appropriate, except where the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural, and words of any gender shall not be limited to that gender.(d) Unless otherwise stated in this Trust Agreement:(i) The terms "child" and "children" refer to the immediate offspring of the named parent.(ii) The term "issue" means the descendants in any degree from a common ancestor. The term "issue" is used interchangeably with "descendants," which shall have the same meaning, that is, descendants in any degree from a common ancestor.(iii) A legally adopted child (and any descendants of that child) will be regarded as a descendant of the adopting parent only if the petition for adoption was filed with the court before the child's eighteenth (18th) birthday. If the legal relationship between a parent and child is terminated by a court while the parent is alive, that child and that child's descendants will not be regarded as descendants of that parent. If a parent dies and the legal relationship with that deceased parent's child had not been terminated before that parent's death, the deceased parent's child and that child's descendants will continue to be regarded as descendants of the deceased parent even if the child is later adopted by another person.(iv) An infant in gestation who is later born alive will be deemed to be in being during the period of gestation for the purpose of qualifying the infant, after it is born, as a beneficiary of this Trust.(e) For all purposes under this instrument, a person shall be deemed "incompetent" or "incapacitated" if and so long as a guardian or conservator of the person or estate duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction continues to serve, or upon certification by two physicians (licensed to practice under the laws of the state where the person is domiciled) that such person is unable properly to care for themselves or for their person or property.(f) Property that is to be divided among an individual's surviving or then living descendants, per stirpes, shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are children of the individual who are then living or who have died leaving surviving or then living descendants. A share allocated to a deceased child of the individual shall be divided further among such deceased child's surviving or then living descendants in the same manner.(g) A direction that a Trustee or other person "shall" take an action means that such Trustee or other person shall have no discretion in deciding whether or not to take such action, except that a direction that the Trustee shall make a distribution of income, principal, or both for "any purpose" or under any specific standard shall require the Trustee to make that distribution only if the Trustee first determines that the standard has been met. A statement that the Trustee or other person "may" do something shall give the Trustee or other person absolute and uncontrolled discretion whether or not to do such thing, exercisable by the Trustee or other person alone and subject to correction by a court only if the statement is directed toward a Trustee and such Trustee should act in bad faith, in violation of specific provisions of this Trust, or in violation with the Trustee's fiduciary duties.(h) All tax-related terms shall have the same meaning in this Trust that they have in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All references to the "Code" shall be to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.(i) This Trust Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which taken together shall be deemed the original thereof.(j) Except as otherwise provided in this Trust Agreement, all references in this Trust Agreement to Sections refer to a section or subsections, as the case may be, of this Trust Agreement.10. No Contest. If any legatee or beneficiary under this Trust shall in anyway directly or indirectly dispute any clause or provision of this Trust, or exercise or attempt to exercise any right to take any part or share of the Settlor's estate against the provisions of this Trust, or institute or prosecute, or be in any way directly or indirectly interested or instrumental in the institution or prosecution of, any action, proceeding, contest, or objection, or give any notice, for the purpose of setting aside or invalidating this Trust, or any clause or provision of this Trust, then and in each such case, all provisions for such legatee or beneficiary or for such beneficiary's descendants contained in this Trust shall be wholly null, void, and ineffectual, and the Trust Estate shall be disposed of in like manner as though such legatee or beneficiary had not survived the Settlor leaving no descendants.

Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (OK)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of AttorneyMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in Oklahoma. It includes essential estate planning templates that may be used for a variety of clients in Oklahoma, as well as non-jurisdictional estate planning practice notes, videos, templates, and other practical guidance that can be used to supplement and enhance the Oklahoma-specific resources. When utilizing any non-jurisdictional templates or other guidance, ensure you consult and incorporate Oklahoma laws and customize the template to meet the specific needs of the individual clients.An estate plan is an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, clients should have advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, and possibly various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options.For a full listing of key clauses for use when drafting certain estate planning documents, including wills and testaments and trusts, see:• Trust Clauses Resource Kit• Will Clauses Resource KitInitial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for the client. It is crucial that you determine a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice to seek this information prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets and personal information, such as, children, citizenship, any prior marriages, the desired fiduciaries, etc.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, you must consider the proper tools to meet these objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's tool kit. A will enables the client to designate how assets should be distributed after the client's death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement where a trustor (also known as a grantor or settlor) transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and administers them on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts are classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the trustor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the trustor dies. Note that testamentary trusts are not listed in this section; rather, they are in some of the will templates listed above. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in their estate plan (e.g., to avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, seek out tax benefits, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan should include provisions outlining what should take place upon a client's disability. An advance health care directive can authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf and detail the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in certain circumstances. This serves to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if the individual cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are an essential part of a client's estate plan. A power of attorney is the legal instrument by which an individual (the principal) authorizes another individual (the agent) to make certain business, financial, and personal decisions on the principal's behalf.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information on powers of attorney:Go to table5Current as of: 03/19/2025

Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (MO)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of AttorneyMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in Missouri. It includes essential estate planning templates that may be used for a variety of clients in Missouri, as well as non-jurisdictional estate planning practice notes, videos, templates, and other practical guidance that can be used to supplement and enhance the Missouri-specific resources. When utilizing any non-jurisdictional templates or other guidance, ensure you consult and incorporate Missouri laws and customize the template to meet the specific needs of the individual clients.An estate plan is an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, clients should have advance health care directives, financial powers of attorney, and possibly various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options.For a full listing of key clauses for use when drafting certain estate planning documents, including wills and testaments and trusts, see:• Trust Clauses Resource Kit• Will Clauses Resource KitInitial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for the client. It is crucial that you determine a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice to seek this information prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets and personal information, such as, children, citizenship, any prior marriages, the desired fiduciaries, etc.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, you must consider the proper tools to meet these objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's tool kit. A will enables the client to designate how assets should be distributed after the client's death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement where a trustor (also known as a grantor or settlor) transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and administers them on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts are classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the trustor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the trustor dies.
