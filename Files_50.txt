TEXT OF CALIFORNIA PROBATE CODE SECTION 18100.5(a) The trustee may present a certification of trust to any person in lieu of providing a copy of the trust instrument to establish the existence or terms of the trust. A certification of trust may be executed by the trustee voluntarily or at the request of the person with whom the trustee is dealing.(b) The certification of trust may confirm the following facts or contain the following information:(i) The existence of the trust and date of execution of the trust instrument.(ii) The identity of the settlor or settlors and the currently acting trustee or trustees of the trust.(iii) The powers of the trustee.(iv) The revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding any power to revoke the trust.(v) When there are multiple trustees, the signature authority of the trustees, indicating whether all or less than all of the currently acting trustees are required to sign in order to exercise various powers of the trustee.(vi) The trust identification number, whether a social security number or an employer identification number.(vii) The manner in which title to trust assets should be taken.(viii) The legal description of any interest in real property held in the trust.(c) The certification shall contain a statement that the trust has not been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner which would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect and shall contain a statement that it is being signed by all of the currently acting trustees of the trust. The certification shall be in the form of an acknowledged declaration signed by all currently acting trustees of the trust. The certification signed by the currently acting trustee may be recorded in the office of the county recorder in the county where all or a portion of the real property is located.(d) The certification of trust may, but is not required to, include excerpts from the original trust documents, any amendments thereto, and any other documents evidencing or pertaining to the succession or successor trustees. The certification of trust shall not be required to contain the dispositive provisions of the trust which set forth the distribution of the trust estate.(e) A person whose interest is, or may be, affected by the certification of trust may require that the trustee offering or recording the certification of trust provide copies of those excerpts from the original trust documents, any amendments thereto, and any other documents which designate, evidence, or pertain to the succession of the trustee or confer upon the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction, or both. Nothing in this section is intended to require or imply an obligation to provide the dispositive provisions of the trust or the entire trust and amendments thereto.(f) A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without actual knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting. A person who does not have actual knowledge that the facts contained in the certification of trust are incorrect may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification of trust. Actual knowledge shall not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the trust certification. Any transaction, and any lien created thereby, entered into by the trustee and a person acting in reliance upon a certification of trust shall be enforceable against the trust assets. However, if the person has actual knowledge that the trustee is acting outside the scope of the trust, then the transaction is not enforceable against the trust assets. Nothing contained herein shall limit the rights of the beneficiaries of the trust against the trustee.(g) A person's failure to demand a certification of trust does not affect the protection provided that person by Section 18100, and no inference as to whether that person has acted in good faith may be drawn from the failure to demand a certification of trust. Nothing in this section is intended to create an implication that a person is liable for acting in reliance upon a certification of trust under circumstances where the requirements of this section are not satisfied.(h) Except when requested by a beneficiary or in the context of litigation concerning a trust and subject to the provisions of subdivision (e), any person making a demand for the trust documents in addition to a certification of trust to prove facts set forth in the certification of trust acceptable to the third party shall be liable for damages, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of the refusal to accept the certification of trust in lieu of the requested documents if the court determines that the person acted in bad faith in requesting the trust documents.(i) Any person may record a certification of trust that relates to an interest in real property in the office of the county recorder in any county in which all or a portion of the real property is located. The county recorder shall impose any fee prescribed by law for recording that document sufficient to cover all costs incurred by the county in recording the document. The recorded certification of trust shall be a public record of the real property involved. This subdivision does not create a requirement to record a certification of trust in conjunction with the recordation of a transfer of title of real property involving a trust.

Letter to Client 
[month] [day], [year][name of client][address of client]RE: [name of trust]Dear [name of client]:I am pleased to enclose [the originals of/copies of] your executed Trust Agreement, [name of trust] and the Certification of Trust. We reviewed the final drafts of these documents prior to your signing them at our review meeting of [date of review], and we discussed next steps for funding the trust.The trust agreement creates a revocable trust, sometimes referred to as a living trust or revocable living trust. Your trust is entirely revocable and amendable by you during your lifetime, but the terms become irrevocable at death. Any property that is transferred to the trust during your lifetime or upon your death will be disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement at your death.Your trust addresses the federal estate tax and generation-skipping transfer (GST). This letter provides a summary of the tax planning strategies and goals of the revocable trust that we previously discussed. However, this letter is not a substitute for legal advice. Please reach out to me if you need further clarification on any of the trust terms or as any questions may arise regarding the trust.Federal Estate Tax. The [name of trust] creates a marital trust and a family trust at your death. If the trusts are funded and administered properly, there will be [a reduced amount of/no] federal estate tax due at your death. The trust also includes an optional provision authorizing the executor of the settlor's estate to qualify the marital trust assets as qualified-terminable-interest property (QTIP) to take advantage of the marital deduction. There are advantages to including a QTIP trust provision in an estate plan, which we previously discussed such as:• Providing your named executor with the flexibility to determine the extent of the QTIP election• The possible opportunity to achieve a step-up in basis• The ability to control the distribution of assets at the death of the surviving spouse –and–• The avoidance of estate taxesAfter the death of both you and your spouse, the trustee, [name of trustee upon death of surviving spouse], will continue to hold the trust assets in a trust for the benefit of your [child/children] if [the/any] [child/children] [has/have] not reached [age] years old. The trustee may make distributions of principal and income to your [child/children] [OPTIONAL: and has the flexibility to favor beneficiaries with greater financial needs]. Once the [child/youngest child] reaches age [age], your trustee will distribute all remaining trust principal [OPTIONAL: in equal trust shares] to [the/each] child (or the descendant of [the/a] child if [your child/one of your children] predeceases).GST. The [name of trust] also includes provisions that direct the trustee to split a trust to achieve favorable GST tax treatment. As a reminder, GST tax is imposed on transfers to persons more than one generation below the transferor's generation. For example, gifting a home to your grandchild and "skipping" your own living child triggers the GST tax.Certification of Trust. The Certification of Trust is an alternative to providing a full copy of your Trust Agreement to a requesting third party. The Certification of Trust contains only the minimum amount of information usually required by a third party (e.g., financial institution) and allows you to keep sensitive portions of your Trust Agreement, such as the disposition of property upon your death, confidential.Last Will and Testament. Your Last Will and Testament is a "pour over" will that leaves any probate property in your individual name, if any, to the [name of trust] upon your death so that your trustee will administer it in accordance with the terms of the trust. As we previously discussed, proper funding of your trust by transferring assets into the name of the name of the trust is imperative to achieve the trust's purpose. We also discussed the coordination of beneficiary designations for nonprobate property transfers (e.g., retirement accounts) to align with your overall estate planning goals Please reach out to me as soon as possible if you need any further guidance with funding the trust or changing beneficiary designations.It is essential that you keep these documents in a safe and secure location and inform your appointed trustees, executors, and beneficiaries of their existence and location of the originals. We will reach out to you to confirm funding of the trust as directed. In the meantime, if you need any assistance or have further questions, please feel free to contact our office.

Letter to Client 
Now that you have created a Supplemental Needs Trust, it is important to fund it by transferring ownership of some assets to the trust if you intend to fund it during your lifetime and/or naming the trust as beneficiary if you intend to fund it at your death. Note that if you own any property as joint tenants, all of the joint title owners will need to join in the transfer.i. You will make ownership changes to change the title of some of your assets from your name as an individual to the name of the Trustee as Trustee of the Supplemental Needs Trust.ii. For other assets, such as life insurance and retirement accounts, you will make beneficiary changes to properly distribute those assets upon your death. Note that the beneficiary will not necessarily be your Supplemental Needs Trust (please see the Retirement Plans and Life Insurance Policies and Annuities sections of this document).1. Generally, to transfer assets to your trust, you must execute new documents of title, deeds to real property, and signature cards for your bank accounts. To name the trust as beneficiary, you must execute new change of beneficiary forms for brokerage accounts, pension plans, individual retirement plans and life insurance.Your financial advisor, accountant, broker, or life insurance agent may need to help you make ownership or beneficiary changes. These instructions will give you general knowledge of how to fund your trust, but they cannot comprehensively address every type of transfer. Please call us if you must make transfers that are not addressed in these instructions.(a) We recommend you place copies of all written documents which evidence the interest of your Supplemental Needs Trust into your Supplemental Needs Trust Portfolio. These assets may include your accounts, real property, business interests, insurance policy proceeds, or any other property.Using Your Certification of Trust1. Your Supplemental Needs Trust Portfolio contains a Certification of Trust. In your certification, you state in writing that:The trust exists;who is the Trustee; andthey have the authority and power to transact business as a Trustee.2. Most institutions have their own certification forms for you to fill out. If the institution you are dealing with does not have a form, you should provide them with a copy of your Certification of Trust form. Your Certification of Trust provides only the information that the persons you deal with need to see without disclosing confidential details about the structure of your trust.Your Tax Identification NumberThe trust is irrevocable for tax purposes. This means it will need to file its own separate tax return every year. You need to inform your accountant that you have created this Supplemental Needs Trust. If your trust requires its own separate tax identification number (TIN), we will work with your accountant to obtain one from the IRS. You will need to provide that number to your accountant.Titling Assets in Your Name as TrusteeGenerally, you should title the assets you want to place in the trust in the name of your trust. We prefer the following format for titling assets in the name of your trust:[name of trustee], Trustee of The [name of beneficiary] Supplemental Needs Trust dated [month day, year], and any amendments thereto.Instructions for Transferring Specific AssetsCash Accounts1. You should sign new signature and ownership cards to retitle any sizeable bank accounts or cash equivalents, including treasury bills, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, to name the Trustee as owner of those accounts.2. Before you retitle your certificates of deposit, consult with a bank officer to make sure that the institution does not consider the change in account name to be an early withdrawal that incurs a penalty. Because they are going to be registered under a different taxpayer identification number, this might be an issue.3. Instruct your financial institution by letter or in person to change the title to your trust. The tax identification number will be the new TIN for the trust. For joint trustee trusts, be sure to give each trustee signature power with respect to the account. Sign the new signature cards as Trustees.4. After changing title, your next account statement will confirm the retitling by listing the Trustee as the owner of your trust.Investment Accounts1. If you intend to transfer publicly traded stocks and bonds that are already in brokerage or investment accounts, contact your brokers or custodians and direct them to change the title of the accounts to the name of your trust. The procedure for doing so is the same as the procedure for retitling cash accounts explained above. You may have to complete new account applications and present a copy of your Affidavit or Certification of Trust in order to change the title. Title to the accounts should be in the trust name.After changing title, the next account statement will confirm the retitling by listing the Trustee as the owner of your trust. The TIN on the account statements should reflect the TIN of the Supplemental Needs Trust.Stocks and Bonds Not Held in Investment AccountsIf you possess original stock or bond certificates, there are two ways to transfer the certificates to your trust:1. Open a brokerage or investment account in the name of your Supplemental Needs Trust and deposit your original certificates in the account. (You may later have your broker deliver the certificates to you made out in the name of the trust if you wish.) Your future account statements that will be titled in the name of your Supplemental Needs Trust will prove your ownership of the transferred stock or bonds. The TIN on the account statements should reflect the TIN of the Supplemental Needs Trust.2. Work directly with the transfer agent for the stock or bond and direct the agent to reissue your stock with your Supplemental Needs Trust named as the new owner.Since the trust is a separate taxpaying entity, it is important for you to understand whether your trust is a grantor trust. We will let you know. If your trust is a grantor trust, you, and not the trust, will be responsible for payment of income taxes. If it is not a grantor trust, please be mindful that the trust reaches the highest marginal income tax rate at $14,451 of income. Due to the rules that govern Supplemental Needs Trusts, it may not be possible to distribute the income out to the beneficiary. If the income remains in the trust, the trust must pay the income tax on an annual basis. Therefore, consider tax exempt income sources, such as municipal bonds for non-grantors.Stock OptionsTransferring or assigning stock options requires a careful analysis of the tax and legal issues. We recommend you ask your Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and your stock plan administrator about your choices in assigning your interests to your Supplemental Needs Trust. If you would like us to assist you, we would be willing to do so under a separate representation agreement.Retirement PlansYou should never transfer the ownership of a qualified retirement or pension plan (such as a 401(k) or 403(b)) or individual retirement account (IRA) to your Supplemental Needs Trust. Instead, if you have pre-retirement death benefits under such a plan, our general recommendation is that if you are not married, you name the Supplemental Needs Trust as primary beneficiary. If you are married, you may opt to name your spouse as the primary beneficiary and make the Supplemental Needs Trust the contingent/secondary beneficiary.1. Making the proper beneficiary designations for retirement plans involves many complex tax and individual family issues. IRAs and other retirement plans can make excellent assets for an SNT. The required minimum distributions can be accumulated in the trust, over the lifetime of the beneficiary. Since they are in an irrevocable trust, they cannot be reached by the beneficiary's creditors, and will not jeopardize government benefits.2. If you would like to discuss the issues and solutions for designating your retirement plan beneficiaries to best match your unique goals, we would be pleased to do so. But this additional planning must be done under a subsequent written representation agreement.3. Your retirement plan administrator should send you a letter confirming the change of beneficiaries in your retirement plan records.Life Insurance Policies and Annuities1. You may want to tax-proof your major life insurance policies by causing an irrevocable Supplemental Needs Trust to become the owner of the insurance policy. Alternatively, you may want to own the policy, and have the proceeds paid directly to your Supplemental Needs Trust. By consulting with us, we can help you understand the distinction and determine the proper ownership and beneficiary designation for each policy.2. If you decide to name your Supplemental Needs Trust as the primary beneficiary of a policy, here are several points you should consider:(i) Your policy beneficiary designation, not your Will or Supplemental Needs Trust, controls the disposition of the policy benefits. This means the life insurance company will pay the policy proceeds directly to the Trustee of the Supplemental Needs Trust after your death.(ii) Generally, you should designate your Supplemental Needs Trust as the beneficiary of your life insurance policy so the policy proceeds will be governed by the terms of the Supplemental Needs Trust. To do so, we recommend you advise your insurance agent that you want your Supplemental Needs Trust named as the primary beneficiary. Your agent will make the change for you or provide you the beneficiary designation form for you to complete.(iii) Each insurance company will have its own preferred format for designating your Supplemental Needs Trust as the beneficiary. Here is a typical format:Primary Beneficiary: The [name of client] Supplemental Needs Trust dated [month day, _____]Secondary Beneficiary: Spouse, partner, children, or other heirs.3. Your insurance company should send you a letter confirming the change of beneficiaries in your insurance policy or annuity records.Mortgage, Notes, and Other Receivables1. If you have loaned money to anyone, you may choose to assign your interest as lender to your Supplemental Needs Trust by a written document and notify your debtor of the assignment. We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Partnership InterestIf there are no restrictions in your partnership agreement, your interest in the partnership may be transferred through a written assignment of interest signed by you and acknowledged by your partners.1. We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Corporate Business or Professional InterestsYou should contact your corporate counsel or ask us whether it is permissible under law to transfer any professional business interests you hold to the Supplemental Needs Trust. For other corporate business interests, it is important that you understand the potential tax implications of transferring your corporate interest to the Supplemental Needs Trust. To the extent it is legal and practical, we can assist you in transferring any professional business interests or other corporate interests to the Supplemental Needs Trust.1. If your business is a corporation, you will have to cancel shares held in your name and reissue them in the name of the Trustee of your Supplemental Needs Trust.2. Alternatively, you can elect to transfer a corporate or professional business interest to the Supplemental Needs Trust at death. We can assist you by preparing a transfer on death designation.3. If your business is a limited liability company, we will draft assignment documents to assign your interest to your Supplemental Needs Trust.Oil, Gas, and Mineral Interests1. The method of transferring interests in oil, minerals, and gas depends on whether you own or lease the interests. Generally, if you own the interests, you should record a deed that titles your interests to your Supplemental Needs Trust. If your interest is a lease, you should assign your rights as a lessee to your Supplemental Needs Trust by a written assignment. We can assist you with the preparation of a deed or assignment document.Real Property1. Transferring real property to your trust will require attention to ownership and tax issues based on the nature of the current title to the property. Ultimately, the transfer will require preparing, executing, and recording new deeds for each property. This should be done through an attorney. At your request, we will assist you with this.2. Regarding any homeowner's policy, contact your insurance provider to discuss adding your trust as an additional endorsee on your policy.Anticipated Inheritance, Gift, or Lawsuit Judgment for YouIf you are the beneficiary of an estate of someone who has already died, or if you are a plaintiff in a lawsuit, you can assign your interest in the estate or lawsuit to your Supplemental Needs Trust in case you are disabled or deceased before receiving distributions or payments.Anticipated Inheritance or Gift for the SNT BeneficiaryWell-meaning relatives may want to help out the beneficiary in their own way. You should inform anyone so inclined that their check or gift should be payable to the Trustee of the Trust. Any funds going directly to the beneficiary can disqualify them from receiving government benefits.
[optional acknowledgment to add:]Funding AcknowledgementI acknowledge that counsel has advised me about the importance of funding my Supplemental Needs Trust, and I understand that after the initial funding has been completed by [name of attorney], it is my responsibility to fund any future assets to my Supplemental Needs Trust. Therefore, I understand that my attorney, [name of attorney] is not responsible for any future funding of my Supplemental Needs Trust.

[month] [day], [year][name of clients][address of clients]RE: Funding of Joint Revocable Living TrustDear [names of clients]:Now that you have established your Joint Revocable Living Trust (the "Trust"), you should fund it by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. An unfunded or partially funded trust does not avoid probate. While your Pour Over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in the Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of the Trust as further outlined in this letter.Please review your assets to determine which to transfer into the Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Certain assets should not be transferred to the Trust during your lifetime, for example, individual retirement accounts and some types of annuities.Generally, to transfer assets to the Trust, you must execute new documents of title, deeds to real property, and signature cards for your bank accounts. Your financial advisor, accountant, or life insurance agent may need to help you make ownership or beneficiary changes. These instructions will give you general knowledge of how to fund the Trust, but they cannot comprehensively address every type of transfer. Please call us if you must make transfers that are not addressed in these instructions, or if you would like assistance with any of these transfers. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds, and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Generally, you should title all of your currently owned and newly acquired assets in the name of the Trust. We prefer the following format for titling assets in the name of the Trust:[names of clients], as Co-Trustees of the [name of joint revocable living trust] dated [month], [day] [year], and any amendments thereto.We recommend you keep copies of all written documents which evidence the ownership interest of the Trust. Additionally, it is good practice to keep a list of all assets transferred to the Trust, along with the date of transfer, on Schedule A of the Trust.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your names alone, holding assets in joint names, or transferring assets to the Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Living Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Instructions for Transferring Specific Assets Cash Accounts You should sign new signature and ownership cards to retitle any sizable bank accounts or cash equivalents, including treasury bills, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, to name yourselves as Co-Trustees of those accounts. You need not change any small joint or other checking accounts used primarily for household or everyday expenses.Before you retitle your certificates of deposit, consult with a bank officer to make sure that the institution does not consider the change in account name to be an early withdrawal that incurs a penalty. Generally, this should not be a problem because your tax identification number for the account will remain the same.Instruct your financial institution by letter or in person to change the title to the Trust. The tax identification numbers (your Social Security numbers) on the account for withholding and reporting purposes will remain the same. Sign the new signature cards as Co-Trustees.Investment Accounts If you hold publicly traded stocks and bonds through brokerage or investment accounts, contact your brokers or custodians and direct them to change the title of the accounts to the name of your Trust. The procedure for doing so is the same as the procedure for retitling cash accounts explained above. You may have to complete new account applications and present a copy of your Certification of Trust to change the title. Title to the accounts should be in the Trust name.Stocks and Bonds Not Held in Investment Accounts If you possess original stock or bond certificates, new certificates may be issued to reflect the Co-Trustees' ownership of the stock or shares. Alternatively, you may open a brokerage or investment account in the name of the Trust and deposit your original certificates in the account. Be sure to keep track of the income tax basis of all shares because you need this information if any shares are sold during your lifetimes.Personal Effects Tangible personal property refers to such items as household furnishings, appliances and fixtures, works of art, motor vehicles, pictures, collectibles, personal wearing apparel and jewelry, books, sporting goods, and hobby paraphernalia. You can transfer your tangible personal property by executing an Assignment of Personal Property.Your personal vehicles can be titled in the name of the Trust, but we find that most of our clients prefer to leave their vehicles outside their trust. However, should you decide to title your vehicle in the name of the Trust, consult your casualty insurance agent and advise them of the change.Retirement Plans, Life Insurance Policies, and Annuities Generally speaking, ownership of these accounts should not be transferred to the Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the surviving Co-Trustee/Successor Trustee for distribution under the terms of the Trust. Designating the Trust as beneficiary of an annuity or retirement account may have unintended income tax consequences. Please contact me or your tax professional prior to making any such designation.Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, you may want the proceeds from the policies paid directly to the Trust. To designate the Trust as the beneficiary, you need to obtain and complete change-of-beneficiary forms. Your agent should be able to assist you with naming the surviving Co-Trustee/Successor Trustee of the Trust as the beneficiary of the policy, or if not, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you. You should receive a letter confirming the change-of-beneficiary from the insurance company to keep with the Trust records.Partnership Interests If there are no restrictions in your partnership agreement, your interest in the partnership could be transferred through a written assignment of interest signed by you and acknowledged by your partners. It may be necessary to prepare a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement.We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Real Property Transferring real property to the Trust will require attention to ownership and tax issues based on the nature of the current title to the property. You need to execute new deeds for each property. At your request, we will assist you with this.Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger a "due on sale" clause in the instrument. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located.You should contact your homeowner's insurance provider to discuss adding the Trust as an additional endorsee on your policy. Lastly, you may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Administering the Trust If a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Trust to complete the transfer, use the Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire Trust Agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to you, as Co-Trustees, of the Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by you as Co-Trustees, rather than by you individually. For example, after corporate stock is transferred to you as Co-Trustees, it is you as Co-Trustees who have the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by you as Co-Trustees.While you are acting as Co-Trustees of the Trust, you do not need to obtain a separate tax identification number for the Trust or file a separate trust tax return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prefers that you use your own Social Security number. You should report all of the income generated by trust assets on your personal IRS Form 1040.When [you both die/the first of you dies], the Trust becomes irrevocable. After both of you are deceased, the Successor Trustee will need to obtain a tax identification number. We will work with your Successor Trustee and your accountant to see that your heirs get the full benefit of your estate planning upon your death.You should review your estate plan with an attorney every two to three years because all estate plans require on-going maintenance. In particular, a change in your family circumstances, an increase in your net worth, or a change in the tax law could significantly affect the effectiveness of your plan.I hope that this letter answers most, if not all, of your immediate questions. Please call me if you have any additional questions about the transfer of property to the Trust or about the operation of the Trust in the future. At death, the surviving Co-Trustee/Successor Trustee must follow certain trust administration procedures, and it is advisable for the Co-Trustee/Successor Trustee to consult with an attorney at that time. This letter is for your guidance only and does not discuss all possible situations. Please keep it for future reference.

When signing this document, you must specify when the agent's authority is to become effective and whether you wish to limit the agent's decision-making authority.

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][month] [day], [year][name of client][address of client]RE: [name of trust]Dear [name of client]:I am pleased to enclose [the originals of/copies of] your executed Trust Agreement, [name of trust], the Certification of Trust, and your Last Will and Testament. Prior to execution, we carefully reviewed the final drafts of these documents during our meeting on [date of review], at which time we also discussed the next steps for funding your trust.The trust agreement creates a revocable trust, sometimes referred to as a living trust or revocable living trust. Under North Carolina law, your trust is entirely revocable and amendable by you during your lifetime, but the terms become irrevocable at death. Any property that is transferred to the trust during your lifetime or upon your death will be disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement at your death.Your trust addresses the federal estate tax and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax. This letter provides a summary of the tax planning strategies and goals of the revocable trust that we previously discussed. However, this letter is not a substitute for legal advice. Please reach out to me if you need further clarification on any of the trust terms or as any questions may arise regarding the trust.Federal Estate Tax. The [name of trust] creates a marital trust and a family trust at your death. If the trusts are funded and administered properly, there will be [a reduced amount of/no] federal estate tax due at your death. The trust also includes an optional provision authorizing the executor of the settlor's estate to qualify the marital trust assets as qualified-terminable-interest property (QTIP) to take advantage of the marital deduction. There are advantages to including a QTIP trust provision in an estate plan, which we previously discussed such as:• Providing your named executor with the flexibility to determine the extent of the QTIP election• The possible opportunity to achieve a step-up in basis• The ability to control the distribution of assets at the death of the surviving spouse –and–• Minimizing or deferring federal estate taxesThe assets held in your revocable trust at your death are included in your federal taxable estate. As a result, if your taxable estate exceeds the federal estate tax exemption amount ($13.99 million per individual in 2025), your executor must file a federal estate tax return (Form 706) within nine months of your death. While filing extensions are available, any estate taxes must be paid by the original due date to avoid penalties and interest.After the death of both you and your spouse, the trustee, [name of trustee upon death of surviving spouse], will continue to hold the trust assets in a trust for the benefit of your [child/children] if [the/any] [child/children] [has/have] not reached [age] years old. The trustee may make distributions of principal and income to your [child/children] [OPTIONAL: and has the flexibility to favor beneficiaries with greater financial needs]. Once the [child/youngest child] reaches age [age], your trustee will distribute all remaining trust principal [OPTIONAL: in equal trust shares] to [the/each] child (or the descendant of [the/a] child if [your child/one of your children] predeceases).GST. The [name of trust] also includes provisions that direct the trustee to divide a trust to achieve favorable GST tax treatment. As a reminder, GST tax is imposed on transfers to persons more than one generation below the transferor's generation. For example, gifting a home to your grandchild and "skipping" your own living child triggers the GST tax.Certification of Trust. The Certification of Trust serves as an alternative to the full Trust Agreement to a requesting third party. It includes only the essential information typically required by a third party (e.g., financial institution), allowing you to maintain the confidentiality of more sensitive terms of your Trust Agreement, such as how assets will be distributed upon your death.Last Will and Testament. Your Last Will and Testament is a "pour over" will that leaves any probate property in your individual name, if any, to the [name of trust] upon your death so that your trustee will administer it in accordance with the terms of the trust. As we previously discussed, proper funding of your trust by transferring assets into [name of the trust] is imperative to achieve the trust's purpose. We also discussed the coordination of beneficiary designations for nonprobate property transfers (e.g., retirement accounts) to align with your overall estate planning goals. Please reach out to me as soon as possible if you need any further guidance with funding the trust or changing beneficiary designations.It is essential that you keep these documents in a safe and secure location and inform your appointed trustees, executors, and beneficiaries of their existence and location of the originals. If you need any assistance or have further questions, please feel free to contact me at [attorney's phone number and/or email address]. My team and I are here to provide any further assistance.Thank you for placing your confidence in our firm with your estate planning affairs.

Table of Contents
[month] [day], [year][name of client][address of client]Dear [name of client]:I am writing regarding the [name of beneficiary] Special Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year] ("the Trust"), which we have prepared for you, as [trustor of the Trust/trustee of the Trust/both trustor and trustee of the Trust].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the Trust; and (2) discuss what you, as [trustor/trustee/trustor and trustee] of the Trust need to know and think about in the future. Therefore, I advise you to keep this letter for future reference.To accomplish the long-term goals of the trust, the trustor and trustee must adhere to the terms in the Trust and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to the Trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or the person who prepares your tax returns.The Trust describes the responsibilities and the powers of the trustee(s). Since all trust agreements (also called trust instruments) do not contain the same powers, the trustee must pay special attention to the language in the Trust to be certain of the authority and options granted. The trustee's actions in administering the Trust will have a direct impact on fulfilling the trustor's intent and properly protecting the beneficiary.The Trust is a Third-Party Special Needs Trust created so that the family and friends of [name of beneficiary], the beneficiary of the Trust, can make gifts to benefit [name of beneficiary] while preserving [name of beneficiary]'s right to receive government benefits. The gifts made to the Trust can take many forms: cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or even personal property. Under no circumstances should anyone transfer property or assets belonging to the beneficiary into the Trust. If this happens, it could jeopardize the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. Also, the beneficiary has no right to demand or withdraw any assets or property from the Trust.1. Irrevocability of Trust. The Trust is an irrevocable trust. That means it is fixed and cannot be amended. Also, gifts made to the Trust cannot be returned.2. Federal Tax Identification Number. Whether or not the Trust needs its own federal tax identification number depends on whether the Trust is a grantor trust or not. A grantor trust is a trust over which the grantor or other owner retains the power to control or direct the trust's income or assets. If the Trust is a grantor trust, the trustee has the choice of reporting the annual income for federal tax purposes on either IRS Form 1041 or on the income tax return of the grantor. A grantor trust does not need its own tax identification number and the grantor may use grantor's own social security number for tax reporting purposes. If the Trust is not a grantor trust, meaning no grantor or trustor retains the power to control or direct any of the trust's income or assets, either the trustee or the attorney for the Trust must obtain a federal tax identification number for the trust by filing IRS Form SS4. The tax identification number identifies the Trust in bank accounts and tax returns. The Trust [was/was not] drafted to qualify as a grantor trust.3. Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the Trust to be effective. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the Trust, as follows: "[name of trustee], Trustee of The [name of beneficiary] Special Needs Trust dated [month] [day], [year]." (Your bank may want to use a slightly different name.) If the Trust is not a grantor trust, always use the trust's tax identification number as the identification number for bank accounts.Your bank or stockbroker may request a copy of the signed trust agreement for examination by their legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire trust agreement. A Certification of Trust and/or a copy of the signature page and the trustee powers will demonstrate that the Trust was properly executed, and the trustee holds the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business.To transfer real estate into the Trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the Trust.4. Gift Tax Return. Generally, if any gift to the Trust exceeds $18,000.00 in value, the donor should be instructed to complete a gift tax return (IRS Form 709) by April 15 of the following year. Please consult me concerning allocating some or all of your generation-skipping tax exemption to this Trust.5. Taxation of Trust Income. The trustee must file IRS Form 1041 to report the income for any year in which the Trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year following the taxable year. Although tax software is widely available for this purpose, we strongly recommend having these forms prepared by an accountant because of their complexity.6. Distributions from the Trust. The types of distributions allowed to the disabled beneficiary are limited to those which will not jeopardize the benefits they receive from any county, state, federal, or other government agency. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support (for example, housing, food, clothing, and medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds are available). Examples of permissible distributions include automobile, computer equipment, subscriptions, travel, furniture, education (tuition, books, supplies), health insurance, life insurance, sports equipment, tickets to events, and leisure activities exceeding the necessities of life, all which are meant to enhance quality of life, not provide basic support. Cash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.7. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:(a) There are no more assets in the trust.(b) The disabled beneficiary dies, and the assets of the trust are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.(c) The beneficiary has become ineligible for public benefits, per Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.8. Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers is in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the Trust. Please read them and make sure you understand them. I am happy to answer any questions about them.9. Record Keeping. It is important that the trustee keep an inventory of assets of the Trust over the life of the Trust, the trustee should keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the Trust. The trustor and the trustee will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust.
I hope this letter answers your immediate questions. If you would like further explanation of any aspect of administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.Sincerely,____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

[month] [day], [year][name of client][address of client]RE: [name of trust]Dear [name of client]:I am pleased to enclose [the originals of/copies of] your executed Trust Agreement, [name of trust], and the Certification of Trust. We reviewed the final drafts of these documents prior to your signing them at our review meeting on [date of review], and we discussed next steps for funding the trust.The trust agreement creates a revocable trust, sometimes referred to as a living trust or revocable living trust. Under Massachusetts law, your trust is entirely revocable and amendable by you during your lifetime, but the terms become irrevocable at death. Any property that is transferred to the trust during your lifetime or upon your death will be disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement at your death.Your trust addresses the federal and Massachusetts estate tax and generation-skipping transfer (GST).

Please reach out to me if you need further clarification on any of the trust terms or as any questions may arise regarding the trust.Federal and Massachusetts Estate Tax. The [name of trust] creates a marital trust and a family trust at your death. If the trusts are funded and administered properly, there will be [a reduced amount of/no] federal and/or state estate tax due at your death. The trust also includes an optional provision authorizing the executor of the settlor's estate to qualify the marital trust assets as qualified-terminable-interest property (QTIP) to take advantage of the marital deduction. There are advantages to including a QTIP trust provision in an estate plan, which we previously discussed such as: • Providing your named executor with the flexibility to determine the extent of the QTIP election• The possible opportunity to achieve a step-up in basis• The ability to control the distribution of assets at the death of the surviving spouse –and–• Minimizing or deferring both federal and Massachusetts estate taxesIt is important to remember that Massachusetts imposes a separate state estate tax under Massachusetts law (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 65C), even if no federal estate tax is due. Massachusetts estate tax applies if the taxable estate exceeds the Massachusetts exemption amount of [current amount (e.g., $2 million for deaths after January 1, 2023)]. The assets held in your revocable trust at your death are included in your Massachusetts taxable estate. As a result, your executor must file a Massachusetts estate tax return (Form M-706) and, if applicable, a federal estate tax return (Form 706) within nine months of your death. While filing extensions are available, any estate taxes must be paid by the original due date to avoid penalties and interest.After the death of both you and your spouse, the trustee, [name of trustee upon death of surviving spouse], will continue to hold the trust assets in a trust for the benefit of your [child/children] if [the/any] [child/children] [has/have] not reached [age] years old. The trustee may make distributions of principal and income to your [child/children] [OPTIONAL: and has the flexibility to favor beneficiaries with greater financial needs]. Once the [child/youngest child] reaches age [age], your trustee will distribute all remaining trust principal [OPTIONAL: in equal trust shares] to [the/each] child (or the descendant of [the/a] child if [your child/one of your children] predeceases).GST. The [name of trust] also includes provisions that direct the trustee to split a trust to achieve favorable GST tax treatment. As a reminder, GST tax is imposed on transfers to persons more than one generation below the transferor's generation. For example, gifting a home to your grandchild and "skipping" your own living child triggers the GST tax.Certification of Trust. The Certification of Trust is an alternative to providing a full copy of your Trust Agreement to a requesting third party. The Certification of Trust contains only the minimum amount of information usually required by a third party (e.g., financial institution) and allows you to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive terms of your Trust Agreement, such as the disposition of property upon your death.Last Will and Testament. Your Last Will and Testament is a "pour over" will that leaves any probate property in your individual name, if any, to the [name of trust] upon your death so that your trustee will administer it in accordance with the terms of the trust.

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][Month Day, 20__][name of client][address of client]RE: Funding of Revocable Living TrustDear [name of client]:Now that you have established your Revocable Living Trust (the "Trust"), you should fund it by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. An unfunded or partially funded trust does not avoid probate. While your Pour-Over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in the Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as further outlined in this letter.Please review your assets to determine which to transfer into your Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Certain assets should not be transferred to the trust during your lifetime, for example, IRAs and some types of annuities.Generally, to transfer assets to your trust, you must execute new documents of title, deeds to real property, and signature cards for your bank accounts. Your financial advisor, accountant, or life insurance agent may need to help you make ownership or beneficiary changes. These instructions will give you general knowledge of how to fund your trust, but they cannot comprehensively address every type of transfer. Please call us if you must make transfers that are not addressed in these instructions, or if you would like assistance with any of these transfers. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds, and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Generally, you should title all of your currently owned and newly acquired assets in the name of your Trust. We prefer the following format for titling assets in the name of your Trust:[name of client], as Trustee of the [name of Revocable Living Trust] dated [Month, Day 20__], and any amendments thereto.We recommend you keep copies of all written documents which evidence the ownership interest of your Trust. Additionally, it is good practice to keep a list of all assets transferred to the Trust, along with the date of transfer, on Schedule A of the Trust.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Living Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Instructions for Transferring Specific AssetsCash AccountsYou should sign new signature and ownership cards to retitle any sizeable bank accounts or cash equivalents, including treasury bills, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, to name yourself as Trustee of those accounts. You need not change any small joint or other checking accounts used primarily for household or everyday expenses.Before you retitle your certificates of deposit, consult with a bank officer to make sure that the institution does not consider the change in account name to be an early withdrawal that incurs a penalty. Generally, this should not be a problem because your tax identification number for the account will remain the same.Instruct your financial institution by letter or in person to change the title to your trust. The tax identification number (your Social Security number) on the account for withholding and reporting purposes will remain the same. Sign the new signature cards as Trustee.Investment AccountsIf you hold publicly traded stocks and bonds through brokerage or investment accounts, contact your brokers or custodians and direct them to change the title of the accounts to the name of your Trust. The procedure for doing so is the same as the procedure for retitling cash accounts explained above. You may have to complete new account applications and present a copy of your Certification of Trust in order to change the title. Title to the accounts should be in the trust name.Stocks and Bonds Not Held in Investment AccountsIf you possess original stock or bond certificates, new certificates may be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. Alternatively, you may open a brokerage or investment account in the name of your Revocable Living Trust and deposit your original certificates in the account.Personal EffectsTangible personal property refers to such items as household furnishings, appliances and fixtures, works of art, motor vehicles, pictures, collectibles, personal wearing apparel and jewelry, books, sporting goods, and hobby paraphernalia. You can transfer your tangible personal property by executing an Assignment of Personal Property.Your personal vehicles can be titled in the name of your Revocable Living Trust, but we find that most of our clients prefer to leave their vehicles outside their trust. However, should you decide to title your vehicle in the name of the Trust, consult your casualty insurance agent and advise them of the change.Retirement Plans, Life Insurance Policies, and AnnuitiesGenerally speaking, ownership of these accounts should not be transferred to your Revocable Living Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the Trust. Designating the Trust as beneficiary of an annuity or retirement account may have unintended income tax consequences. Please contact me or your tax professional prior to making any such designation.Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, you may want the proceeds from the policies paid directly to your Revocable Living Trust. In order to designate the Revocable Living Trust as the beneficiary, you will need to obtain and complete change-of-beneficiary forms. Your agent should be able to assist you with naming the Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust as the beneficiary of the policy, or if not, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you. You should receive a letter confirming the change of beneficiary from the insurance company to keep with your trust records.Partnership InterestsIf there are no restrictions in your partnership agreement, your interest in the partnership could be transferred through a written assignment of interest signed by you and acknowledged by your partners. It may be necessary to prepare a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement.We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Real PropertyTransferring real property to your trust will require attention to ownership and tax issues based on the nature of the current title to the property. You will need to execute new deeds for each property. At your request, we will assist you with this.Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger a "due on sale" clause in the instrument. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located.You should contact your homeowner's insurance provider to discuss adding your Trust as an additional endorsee on your policy. Lastly, you may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Administering the TrustIf a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Revocable Living Trust to complete the transfer, use a Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire trust agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually. For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.As long as you are acting as Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust, you do not need to obtain a separate tax identification number for your trust or to file a separate trust tax return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prefers that you use your own Social Security number. You should report all of the income generated by trust assets on your personal IRS Form 1040.When you die, your trust becomes irrevocable and the successor Trustee will need to obtain a tax identification number. We will work with your successor Trustee and your accountant to see that your heirs get the full benefit of your estate planning upon your death.You should review your estate plan with an attorney every two to three years because all estate plans require on-going maintenance. In particular, a change in your family circumstances, an increase in your net worth, or a change in the tax law could significantly affect the effectiveness of your plan.I hope that this letter answers most, if not all, of your immediate questions. Please call me if you have any additional questions about the transfer of property to your Trust or about the operation of the Trust in the future. At death, certain trust administration procedures will be required, and it is advisable for the successor Trustee to consult with an attorney at that time. This letter is for your guidance only and does not discuss all possible situations. Please keep it for future reference.Sincerely yours,[name of attorney]End of Document

Letter to Client 
Table of Contents
Dear [name of client]:I am writing with regard to the [name of beneficiary] Special Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year], which we have prepared for you, as [settlor of the trust/trustee of the trust/both settlor and trustee of the trust].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust; and (2) discuss what you, as [settlor / settlor and trustee] of the trust need to know and think about in the future. Therefore, I advise you to keep this letter for future reference.In order to accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the settlor and trustee must adhere to the terms set forth in the trust document and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or the person who prepares your tax returns.The trust describes the responsibilities and the powers of the trustee(s). Since all trust documents (also called trust instruments) do not contain the same powers, the trustee must pay special attention to the language in the trust to be certain of the trustee's authority and options.This trust is a Third-Party Special Needs Trust. It is designed so that the family and friends of [name of beneficiary], the beneficiary of the trust, can make gifts to benefit [him/her/them] while preserving [his/her/their] right to receive government benefits. The gifts made to the trust can take many forms: cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or even personal property. Under no circumstances should any property or assets belonging to the beneficiary be transferred into the trust. If this is done, it could jeopardize the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. Also, the beneficiary has no right to demand or withdraw any assets or property from the trust.1. Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust. That means it is fixed and cannot be amended, except under very limited circumstances. Also, gifts made to the trust cannot be returned. Please call me if you need to make any changes to the trust.2. Federal Tax Identification Number. Whether or not the trust needs its own Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN) depends on whether the trust is a grantor trust or not. A grantor trust is a trust over which the grantor or other owner retains the power to control or direct the trust's income or assets. If the trust is a grantor trust, the trustee has the choice of reporting the annual income for federal tax purposes on either IRS Form 1041 or on the income tax return of the grantor. A grantor trust does not need its own tax identification number. If the trust is not a grantor trust, either the trustee or the attorney for the trust must obtain a federal tax identification number for the trust by filing IRS Form SS4. The trust will then need to file IRS Form 1041 to report income. The tax identification number will be used to identify the trust in bank accounts and tax returns.3. Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee in order for the trust to be in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[Name of Trustee], Trustee of The [Name of Beneficiary] Special Needs Trust dated [Month] [Day] [Year]." (Your bank may want to use a slightly different name.) Likewise, the same title should be used for beneficiary designations of any assets naming the trust as beneficiary. However, individuals should use caution when considering naming the trust as beneficiary of an ERISA-governed retirement plan or IRA as the stretch tax rules for inherited retirement accounts could affect the trust beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. If the trust is not a grantor trust, always use the trust's TIN as the identification number for bank accounts.Your stockbroker may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by their firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers will demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. A certification of trust prepared in accordance with South Carolina law may also sometimes be used in lieu of the entire trust agreement.To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust unless transferred upon death.4. Gift Tax Return. If any gift to the Trust exceeds $17,000.00 in value for 2023 or $18,000.00 in value for 2024 (amount adjusted annually), the donor should be instructed to complete a gift tax return (IRS Form 709) by April 15 of the following year.Please consult me concerning allocating some or all of your generation-skipping tax exemption to this trust.5. Taxation of Trust Income. The trustee is required to file IRS Form 1041 and South Carolina Form SC1041 to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year following the taxable year. Although tax software is widely available for this purpose, we strongly recommend having these forms prepared by an accountant because of their complexity.6. Distributions from the Trust. The types of distributions that can be made to the disabled beneficiary are limited to those which will not jeopardize the benefits the beneficiary receives from any county, state, federal, or other government agency. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support (for example, housing, food, clothing, and medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds is available). Here are some examples of permissible distributions: automobile, computer equipment, subscriptions, travel, furniture, education (tuition, books, supplies), health insurance, life insurance, sports equipment, and tickets to events. Cash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary, even if they are reimbursements or prepayments for acceptable expenditures. Instead, payments should be made directly to third parties. Distributions also should not be made to or for the benefit of anyone other than the beneficiary.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.7. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:(a) There are no more assets in the trust.(b) The disabled beneficiary dies and the assets of the trust are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.(c) The beneficiary has become ineligible for public benefits, per Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.8. Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please read them and make sure you understand them. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about them.9. Record Keeping. It is important that the trustee keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. The settlor and the trustee will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust.
I hope that this letter has answered all of your immediate questions. If you would like further explanation of any aspect of administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.Sincerely,_________________[name of attorney]End of Document

[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][month] [day], [year][name of client][address of client]RE: Funding of Revocable Living TrustDear [name of client]:Now that you have established your Revocable Living Trust (the "Trust"), you may fund it by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. An unfunded or partially funded trust does not avoid probate. While your Pour-Over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in the Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as further outlined in this letter.Please review your assets to determine which to transfer into your Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Certain assets should not be transferred to the trust during your lifetime, for example, IRAs and some types of annuities.Generally, to transfer assets to your trust, you must execute new documents of title, deeds to real property, and signature cards for your bank accounts. Your financial advisor, accountant, or life insurance agent may need to help you make ownership or beneficiary changes. These instructions will give you general knowledge of how to fund your trust, but they cannot comprehensively address every type of transfer. Please call us if you must make transfers that are not addressed in these instructions, or if you would like assistance with any of these transfers. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Generally, you should title all of your currently owned and newly acquired assets in the name of your Trust. We prefer the following format for titling assets in the name of your Trust:[name of client], as Trustee of the [name of Revocable Living Trust] dated [month], [day] [year], and any amendments thereto.We recommend you keep copies of all written documents which evidence the ownership interest of your Trust. Additionally, it is good practice to keep a list of all assets transferred to the Trust, along with the date of transfer, on Schedule A of the Trust.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Living Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Instructions for Transferring Specific AssetsCash Accounts You should sign new signature and ownership cards to retitle any sizeable bank accounts or cash equivalents, including treasury bills, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, to name yourself as Trustee of those accounts.

Alternatively, you may open a brokerage or investment account in the name of your Revocable Living Trust and deposit your original certificates in the account. Be sure to keep track of the income tax basis of all shares as the Trustee will need that information if any shares are sold during your lifetime.Personal Effects Tangible personal property refers to such items as household furnishings, appliances and fixtures, works of art, motor vehicles, pictures, collectibles, personal wearing apparel and jewelry, books, sporting goods, and hobby paraphernalia.

You should receive a letter confirming the change of beneficiary from the insurance company to keep with your trust records.Mortgage, Notes, and Other Receivables If you have loaned money to anyone, you should assign your interest as lender to your Revocable Living Trust by a written document and notify your debtor of the assignment. We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Partnership Interests If there are no restrictions in your partnership agreement, your interest in the partnership could be transferred through a written assignment of interest signed by you and acknowledged by your partners. It may be necessary to prepare a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement.We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Oil, Gas, and Mineral Interests The method of transferring interests in oil, minerals, and gas depends on whether you own or lease the interests. Generally, if you own the interests, you should record a deed that titles your interests to your Revocable Living Trust. If your interest is a lease, you should assign your rights as a lessee to your Revocable Living Trust by a written assignment.Real Property Transferring real property to your trust will require attention to ownership and tax issues based on the nature of the current title to the property. You will need to execute new deeds for each property. At your request, we will assist you with this.Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger a "due on sale" clause in the instrument.

Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (MI)
Go to: Amending, Revoking, or Terminating a Trust   |   Drafting Trusts and Tax Considerations   |   Related ContentMaintainedby Dustin S. Foster and Sara A. SchimkeThis practice note addresses revocation, amendment, and termination of trusts in Michigan. It also covers things to consider when drafting a trust, such as the level of discretion granted to a trustee and the extent of his or her powers.For more information on trusts, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (MI).Amending, Revoking, or Terminating a TrustA trust created after April 1, 2010, is presumed to be revocable unless the terms of the trust make it irrevocable. MCL 700.7602. An agent appointed under a durable power of attorney may amend or revoke a living trust only to the extent that the power of attorney or trust gives the agent such power. Once a revocable trust has been revoked, the trustee must deliver the trust assets as the settlor directs. In order to revoke a trust, the settlor must substantially comply with the method set forth in the trust. If the terms of the trust do not give a method for revocation, the settlor can revoke or amend his trust in a writing that provides clear and convincing evidence of the settlor’s intent to revoke or amend his trust. And if the trust is oral, the settlor must manifest clear and convincing evidence of his intent to amend or revoke by any method (e.g., in writing or orally). See MCL 700.7602(3)(b).Beyond the settlor’s revocation, a trust can terminate by its natural terms, which means either all of the assets have been transferred to the beneficiaries and the trust is dry or the trustee no longer has duties to perform. Furthermore, private trusts becoming irrevocable on or after April 1, 2010, can be modified or terminated early but only under a specific set of circumstances. In order for the beneficiaries of a private irrevocable trust to terminate the trust early, the court must approve the request (MCL 700.7411(1)(a)). This request for early termination must come from the trustee and the qualified beneficiaries, and the court must be satisfied that the modification or termination of the trust is consistent with the material purposes of the trust or that continuance of the trust is not necessary to achieve any material purpose of the trust.While material purpose is not specifically defined by the Michigan Trust Code (MTC), the concept has traditionally been defined as language in a trust that has some sort of protective aspect. Therefore, spendthrift language, trustee’s discretionary powers, support language, and even age requirements for disbursement to beneficiaries have all been recognized as creating a material purpose in the trust. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts §?337; Rose v. Southern Michigan Nat'l Bank, 255 Mich. 275, 238 N.W. 284 (1931); Claflin v. Claflin, 149 Mass 19, 20 NE 454 (1889); Adams v. Link, 145 Conn. 634, 145 A2d 753 (1958); In re Bosler's Estate, 161 Pa 457, 107 A2d 443 (1954). The drafters of the MTC also specifically left out an optional provision found in the Uniform Trust Code that specifically states that spendthrift language does not create a material purpose. The drafters went on to state that they felt almost all settlors found the routine spendthrift language material and “if a settlor does not consider the spendthrift language to be a material purpose of the trust . . . the settlor should make his or her intentions clear in the trust instrument.” See MCL 700.7411, Reporter’s Comment. Estate planners should discuss any protective language with their clients to determine the extent to which the client feels the language creates a material purpose which, in turn, may prove to be an impediment to early termination of the trust by the beneficiaries.Outside of court approval, there remains two additional means by which to modify or terminate an irrevocable (noncharitable) trust: upon the consent of the qualified trust beneficiaries and a person or committee who is given the power under the terms of the trust to grant, veto, or withhold approval of termination or modification of the trust; and by a trustee or a person or committee to whom a power to direct the termination or modification of the trust has been given by the terms of a trust. See MCL 700.7411(1)(b) and MCL 700.7411(1)(c).Drafting Trusts and Tax ConsiderationsExtent of DiscretionThe power of a trustee to distribute trust principal for a beneficiary affords flexibility in the face of life’s uncertainties. Even if a beneficiary is granted limited invasion rights, the extent of those rights is often limited by tax law. Further, the beneficiary may become incapacitated so that enforcement is possible only through the appointment of a guardian or conservator, a situation a trust should be drafted to avoid.The extent of the powers of invasion granted to a trustee depend on many considerations: who is the beneficiary of the trust? How great is the client’s concern for the beneficiary? What independent assets are available to the beneficiary? How extensive are the probable needs of the beneficiary? Who is the trustee? What degree of confidence does the client have in the trustee? Is the trustee one who may safely be given broad powers of invasion without adverse tax consequences? Does the beneficiary have the right to remove the trustee and appoint another in its place so that there may be a risk that the beneficiary will be deemed to possess the powers granted to the trustee? Is the trust drawn in a way that the assets almost certainly will be includable in the beneficiary’s estate for federal estate tax purposes so that caution in that regard is unnecessary (e.g., a trust granting a child an unlimited right of withdrawal when the child attains 25 years of age)? All these aspects should be considered and explored with the client.Forms found at the end of this practice note and within this topic represent some approaches, but they do not begin to exhaust the possibilities. Note that the broad powers will lead to includability of the assets in the estate of the favored beneficiary or beneficiaries while the narrow powers should not.Broad AuthorizationsInvasion of a Trust by a BeneficiaryA beneficiary may be given certain rights of invasion of trust principal without adverse federal estate tax consequences. The two most important rights of this type are (1) a right to invade trust principal that is limited by an ascertainable standard and (2) a right to invade trust principal on a noncumulative basis that does not exceed in any year the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the value of the property subject to withdrawal. I.R.C. §?2041. To the extent unexercised in the year of death, this “5 and 5” power exposes the assets subject to the power to federal and state death taxes. The trade-off is a step-up in basis for the trust assets subject to the unexercised power.It is important to recall at the outset that the rules governing income taxation are not identical to those applicable to the federal estate and gift tax laws. Specifically, the holder of a “5 and 5” power is treated, to the extent of the power, as the grantor of the trust. Complex income (and, possibly, gift tax) concerns arise to the extent the beneficiary fails to exercise the power since the beneficiary bears the income tax burden as a grantor even if he or she does not receive any benefit by actually exercising the power.The practitioner also should be aware that the IRS has taken the position that a beneficiary’s right to withdraw under different trust agreements should be aggregated. This may suggest caution in giving a beneficiary the right to invade subject to the $5,000 limitation.Furthermore, there may be Michigan estate taxes assessed on assets subject to a power of appointment, whether general or limited. (As with many states, Michigan has based its estate tax on the provisions of the federal estate tax law. As a result, there is currently no Michigan Estate Tax. The Michigan’s Estate Tax had been a pick-up tax, and is equal to the maximum federal credit allowable for state death taxes. In 2005, the federal government eliminated the credit allowable for state death taxes and that is why Michigan does not currently have an estate tax.)The withdrawal right forms found in this topic demonstrate alternative approaches to granting a beneficiary the right to invade principal. A right of invasion by the beneficiary will protect against tightfistedness by an unduly cautious or unsympathetic trustee. It also may prevent a beneficiary from feeling totally “at the mercy of the trustee.”Conveyance of Real Property Held in TrustReal property can be easily deeded into an express trust by transfer to “John Doe, Trustee, under Trust Agreement dated.” The settlor’s entire interest is then held subject to the terms of an express trust. The trustee acting under the terms of an express trust agreement may be authorized to convey, encumber, or otherwise deal with real property held in trust. Prior to transferring real estate directly into a trust, the practitioner should consider all available ownership options to determine what is best for the client based on his or her particular circumstances. Considerations for the practitioner should include, among other things, maintaining the taxable value of the property on death, preserving a step-up basis for the beneficiaries of the property, and tenancy by the entirety creditor protections.How does a third party know that the trustee may sell or mortgage the land? At a minimum, the third party and a title company will want to examine the trustee’s powers under the trust agreement. The trust agreement then may be recorded along with the conveyance as evidence of the trustee’s authority to deal with the property. For that reason, we recommend that a trust agreement be executed, like any other recordable instrument, by two witnesses and before a notary public.Recording the entire trust agreement is cumbersome and may frustrate a settlor’s desire for privacy. In the alternative, a Certificate of Trust Existence and Authority pursuant to MCL 565.431 et seq. and MCL 700.7913 may be filed as evidence of the trustee’s authority to deal with trust real estate. See Certificate of Trust Existence and Authority (MI). A good faith purchaser relying upon such a certificate shall not be required to further examine the trust agreement unless an instrument amending or revoking the trust agreement or certificate shall have been recorded in the same place as the trust agreement or certificate was recorded.Note that conveyance of real estate to a passive trust (“Richard Roe in trust for Mary Doe”) or to “Richard Roe, Trustee” does not necessarily subject the real estate to trust. Retaining FlexibilitySubject to generation-skipping and perpetuities concerns, a client has considerable flexibility in deciding how, when, and to whom it is best to distribute a Residuary Trust share. Some examples can be found in Payment of Debts (Trust Clause) (MI), Residuary Devise (Trust Clause) (Class Gift) (MI), Family Trust Funding (Trust Clause) (Alternate Planning for GSTT Exemption) (MI), and Income Payments (Trust Clause) (Sprinkling, Residuary Trust) (MI).Overriding LimitationsWhile the fiduciary powers set forth in the forms referenced in this practice note are extensive, the possibilities are, for all practical purposes, endless. At the outset, we include certain special powers applicable to the personal representative.There is the power to advance fees and commissions. This may be helpful in supervised probate administration where the cautious fiduciary now generally seeks court approval before fees are taken; in the face of a challenge, the power should support an early taking of reasonable fees.There also are powers dealing with doctor’s records which may fall under the control of a personal representative.The balance of the supplementary powers expressly permits the trustee to do all things the settlor could do, and perhaps even some things the settlor could not do. For example, there is the power to combine trusts with similar beneficiaries and terms.Finally, there are restrictions on the trustee’s powers, generally intended to avert adverse income or estate and gift tax consequences to a fiduciary who is also a beneficiary.Related ContentForms• Discretionary Invasion by Trustee for Spouse (Trust Clause) (Narrow Form) (MI)• Discretionary Invasion by
