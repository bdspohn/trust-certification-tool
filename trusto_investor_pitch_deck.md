# Trusto Investor Pitch Deck
## Building the Trust Infrastructure for the Digital Age

---

## Slide 1: Title & Hook
**TRUSTO**
*The Plaid for Trusts*

**Making $50 Trillion in Trust Assets as Liquid as a Checking Account**

Trusto.inc | Series A Pitch | 2024

*Subtitle: The infrastructure layer that makes trust transactions as simple as a credit card payment*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem (Personal Pain Points)

### Every Investor in This Room Has Experienced This:

**👨‍💼 Trust Owner (You):**
*"I need to add my trust to my mortgage refinance. The bank wants a 'certification of trust' but rejected my actual trust document. Now I need my lawyer, it'll take 3 weeks, and cost $2,000."*

**🏦 Bank Relationship Manager:**
*"Another trust certification request. Our legal team won't review the full trust, so I'll send our custom form. The client will make errors, it'll bounce back twice, and we'll lose the deal to our competitor."*

### The Hidden Costs:
- **Trust Owners:** $500-2,000 per certification, 2-4 week delays
- **Banks:** $50-100M annually in processing costs (JPMorgan alone)
- **Economy:** Billions in transaction friction and delays

---

## Slide 3: Market Opportunity (Micro to Macro)

### The Trust Economy is Massive and Growing

**10% of Americans own trusts**
**They control 60% of American wealth ($50+ Trillion)**

### Micro Example (Personal Scale):
- **Average trust owner:** 5 financial accounts
- **Life events requiring certification:** Refinance, account changes, property transfers
- **Annual certification needs:** 2-3 per trust owner
- **Current cost per certification:** $500-2,000
- **Time lost:** 2-4 weeks each

### Macro Scale (Market Size):
- **32M+ trust owners** × 2.5 certifications/year = **80M annual certifications**
- **$500 average cost** = **$40B annual market**
- **Just processing costs** = **$8B+ annual inefficiency**

*This market is invisible because it's so fragmented and painful*

## Slide 8: The Flywheel - Network Effects

```
More Trust Owners → More Valuable to Banks → More Banks Join Platform
       ↑                                                    ↓
Better User Experience ← More Data & Learning ← Higher Volume Processing
```

### Why This Creates Defensible Moats:

**Data Network Effects:**
- More trust processing = better AI accuracy
- More bank integrations = universal acceptance  
- More legal precedents = faster resolution

**Supply-Side Economies of Scale:**
- Fixed cost of legal infrastructure spreads across users
- Technology development costs amortize with volume
- Regulatory compliance becomes competitive advantage

**Demand-Side Benefits:**
- Banks prefer platform with most trust owners
- Trust owners prefer platform accepted everywhere
- Legal network effects compound value

*This becomes winner-take-most in trust infrastructure*
