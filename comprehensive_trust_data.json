Trusts can be used for asset protection, tax benefits, to avoid probate and to set up loved ones for financial security in the future. But there's more than simply having a Trust - you also need to understand the Certificate of Trust.\u00a0When the time comes and a Trust Cert is needed, the last thing you want to be dealing with is snags or hang ups. Keep reading to learn more about what a Certificate of Trust is, why you may need one, and most importantly, how to get one.\u00a0What is a certificate of trust How to get a certificate of trust Commonly asked questionsWhat is a Certificate of Trust?A Certification of Trust is a legal document that can be used to certify both the existence of a Trust, as well as to prove a Trustee\u2019s legal authority to act. It\u2019s shorter than the actual Trust document, and it can offer pertinent information without making every aspect of the Trust public.A Trust Certification gives a Trustee the ability to provide anyone who needs it (think: financial institutions or other third parties) important information about the Trust - like the date it was formed, the legal/formal name of the Trust, who the Trustee is (or Trustees are) and other information institutions may require before allowing a Trustee to act.\u00a0\u00a0Appointing a TrusteeWhomever creates the Trust (known as the Grantor) appoints the Trustee or Trustees to manage it. If the Grantor doesn\u2019t properly appoint a Trustee, or if a Trustee fails to live up to the expectations set forth by the Trust, the court may step in to appoint the next logical person to serve the role.\u00a0The appointed Trustee is the legal owner of the title to the assets and property inside the Trust. As such, he or she has a legal responsibility to live up to what\u2019s known as fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. Acting in their best interest can mean many different things, depending on what the Trust itself defines. Trustees may be required to manage and administer assets in the Trust, record expenses, file taxes on income the Trust earns, distribute earnings or funds to beneficiaries, and more.\u00a0\u00a0Certificate of Trust LawsWhile Trusts are valid and recognized in every state, there are no universal or standard laws pertaining to them. This means it\u2019s vital to understand individual and specific state law regarding Trusts where you live.\u00a0Particularly when it comes to what constitutes a Certificate of Trust, states can implement their own statutes. To be recognized as valid, a Certificate of Trust must follow proper guidelines according to the state the Grantor lives in.\u00a0\u00a0State-Specific RequirementsNot all states have statute sections on Certification of Trusts, but those that do follow. If you\u2019re dealing with a Trust in any of the states below, and the Trust Certification complies with the state statute laid out, financial and other institutions must accept the certification or they may face legal and financial consequences.Alabama - Ala.
