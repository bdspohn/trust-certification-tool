Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (GA)
Go to: Amending, Revoking, or Terminating a TrustMaintainedReviewed by Elise MyersThis practice note provides guidance on how to revoke, amend, or terminate a trust under Georgia law, distinguishing between the procedures for revocable and irrevocable trusts. It discusses amendment, reformation, modification, division, consolidation, revocation, and termination under the Revised Georgia Trust Code of 2010. In addition, the note sets forth practice considerations specifically pertaining to revocation, amendment, and termination of trusts.For a full listing of key content on creating an estate plan for an individual with a spouse or partner residing in Georgia, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (GA).For an in-depth discussion of different types of trusts and the purposes of a trust, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (GA). For more information on drafting and administering a trust in Georgia, see Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (GA).Amending, Revoking, or Terminating a TrustThe need for amendment, revocation, and termination usually arises in association with changed circumstances surrounding a trust, including changes to applicable law. As it is impossible to foresee every situation that may come to effect a trust, the estate planning practitioner must address the issue of flexibility with the client and provide a mechanism by which changes can be made. The settlor, beneficiary, or trustee's ability to amend, revoke, or terminate a trust, absent court intervention, depends entirely upon the terms of the trust instrument. Explicit reservation of these powers provides the settlor and other interested parties with the flexibility essential to address future, unknown situations.Too little flexibility can restrict the trust's ability to accomplish its goals. Too much flexibility may give certain individuals an opportunity to take action that contradicts the settlor's intentions. In addition, many settlors fear that granting too much flexibility to amend, revoke, or terminate the trust will result in their intentions and goals for the trust being discarded. When drafting workable trust provisions, the estate planning practitioner must balance the level of flexibility, for example by:• Prohibiting a beneficiary who is also the sole trustee from unilaterally amending, revoking, or terminating a trust• In the case of co-trustees, requiring permitted amendments, revocations, or terminations to be by unanimous consent or by the will of the majority• Requiring amendment, revocation, or termination to be predicated on good causeFor more information on drafting workable yet flexible trust instruments, see 1 Georgia Estate Planning § 8.12.Amending a TrustAlthough a trust may have been planned to take into account every conceivable contingency, circumstances nevertheless occur that were not present or contemplated when the trust was drafted. Such circumstances may lead the settlor to want to amend the trust. The extent to which a trust may be amended and the procedures for doing so depend largely on whether the trust, as drafted, is revocable or irrevocable.Revocable TrustsA settlor does not have power to amend a trust in the absence of an express reservation of that power within the trust instrument. See Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-40(a). In Georgia, the power of revocation includes the power to modify and an unrestricted power to modify includes the power to revoke. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-40(b). Settlors should be made aware that a trust is not considered revocable simply because a life beneficiary has a revision in or a power of appointment over assets of the trust, or because a life beneficiary's heirs or estate have a remainder interest in it. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-44. See also 1 Georgia Estate Planning § 9.2Modification of an express trust must be in writing and signed by the settlor. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-40(c). Further, the settlor must give notice of the amendment to the trustee, otherwise the trustee is not liable for failing to act in accordance with the amended terms and conditions of the trust agreement. See Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-42. As a best practice, any amendment should be executed with the same formalities as the original trust instrument and the amendment should refer specifically to the trust and to the particular provision of the trust being amended.The trust instrument ultimately controls the settlor's ability to amend the trust. If this provision is carefully drafted, the settlor can retain an enormous amount of flexibility as to how the trust is amended. For example, courts have allowed a trust provision providing for alteration by "execution of a written instrument" to allow modification of the trust by power of attorney. While executing a proper amendment is ideal, flexibility provided to a settlor may be necessary and advantageous in certain circumstances. Strange v. Towns, 769 S.E.2d 604 (Ga. Ct. App. 2015). A settlor's powers with respect to amendment of a trust may be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney, but only to the extent expressly authorized by the terms of the trust and the power of attorney instrument. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-43(a). The ability of the settlor's conservator to amend the trust is constrained by Ga. Code Ann. § 29-5-23. See Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-43(b).Counsel should be aware that trustee consent is required for certain modifications. In exercising a power to modify the trust instrument, the settlor may not enlarge the duties or liabilities of the trustee without the trustee's express consent. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-41.Irrevocable TrustsAn irrevocable trust may not be amended except in limited situations permitted by statute. The only way to effect a change in an irrevocable trust is to petition the court for modification of the trust under the provisions of Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61. In addition, the court may in some circumstances reform the terms of a trust to correct a mistake. See Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-60.A proceeding to approve a proposed modification of a trust under Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61 may be commenced by either a trustee, trust director, or a beneficiary. A proceeding may also be commenced by the settlor during his or her lifetime. In the case of an unfunded testamentary trust, the petition may be brought by the personal representative of the settlor's estate. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(e).Modification of an irrevocable trust may be made upon petition to the court in the following circumstances:• Modification with settlor. If the court finds that the settlor and all beneficiaries' consent to the modification or termination of an irrevocable trust, the court shall approve the modification or termination even if the change is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(b).• Modification by consent. After the death of the settlor, the court may, on petition, modify the terms of an irrevocable trust only if (1) all of the beneficiaries' consent, (2) the trustee receives notice, and (3) the court finds that the modification is not inconsistent with any material purpose of the trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(c)(1). After the death of the settlor the court may, on petition, terminate the irrevocable trust. See Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(c)(2).• Unanticipated circumstances. The court may modify an irrevocable trust when there are circumstances not anticipated by the settlor and if such modification would further the purposes of such trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(1).• Inability to administer the trust effectively. The court may modify the trust's administrative terms if continuing the trust on its existing terms would be impracticable and would impair the trust's administration. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(2).• Appointment of additional trustee or special fiduciary. The court may modify the terms of the trust by the appointment of an additional trustee or special fiduciary if such appointment is necessary or helpful to the administration of the trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(3).• Tax objectives. The court may modify the trust to achieve the settlor's tax objectives. Such a modification can be either prospective or retroactive. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(4).• Division and consolidation. The court may order the division of a single trust into two or more trusts. It may also order the consolidation of two or more trusts—whether created by the same or different trust instruments or by the same or different persons—into a single trust. This modification will be effectuated only if the division or consolidation would be helpful to the administration of the trust or trusts. Counsel should be cognizant that the trust instrument itself may confer upon the trustee, or another person, the power to consolidate or divide the trust or trusts without court approval. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(a). Absent the grant of power to combine or consolidate, however, the trustee must petition the court for combination or division of trusts pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(5).• Uneconomical trust. The court may modify or terminate a trust and order the distribution of the trust property if:o The costs of administration are such that the continuance of such trust, the establishment of such trust if it is to be established, or the distribution from a probate estate would defeat or substantially impair the purposes of such trusto The purpose of such trust has been fulfilled or become illegal or impossible to fulfill –or–o Continuance of such trust would impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trustGa. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(6)Reformation to Correct MistakesA trust can be reformed to correct mistakes. If it is proved by clear and convincing evidence that the settlor's intent or the terms of the trust were affected by a mistake of fact or law (whether in expression or inducement), the court may reform the terms of a trust to conform to the settlor's intention. The court may reform the trust terms even if such terms are unambiguous. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-60(a).Reformation of a trust by the court must be upon petition by the trustee or a beneficiary. If the trust is an unfunded testamentary trust, the personal representative of the settlor's estate has standing to petition for reformation. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-60(b). All trustees and beneficiaries are entitled to notice of a petition for reformation of a trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-60(c).Revoking a TrustA settlor may not revoke a trust unless he or she has expressly reserved that power in the trust instrument. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-40(a). Further, the power to revoke the trust includes the power to modify it; and an unrestricted power to modify is deemed to include the power of revocation. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-40(b). Revocation of the trust must be in writing and signed by the settlor. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-40(c). See also 1 Georgia Estate Planning § 9.2.The settlor should inform the trustee of the revocation. A trustee who remains unaware that a trust has been revoked is not liable for failing to act in accordance with the revocation. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-42. Lack of notice of termination to a trustee could result in distributions, incursion of liability, and other acts not contemplated by the settlor when he or she revoked the trust. The best practice is for the settlor to send the trustee a copy of the revoking instrument by a traceable method such as certified or registered mail, or another parcel delivery service that provides tracking. A settlor may also wish to record a revocation into the real property records of any county where real estate assets of the trust are located. This recordation, while not required, will assist title companies in preventing fraudulent transfers of trust property after a revocation has been made but before title of the real estate has reverted to the settlor.A settlor's powers with respect to revocation of a trust may be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney, but only to the extent expressly authorized by the terms of the trust and the power of attorney. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-43(a). The ability of the settlor's conservator to revoke the trust is constrained by Ga. Code Ann. § 29-5-23 which codifies the authority of a conservator and enumerates his or her powers. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-43(b).Terminating a TrustTermination by ExpirationA trust terminates if it expires under its own terms. Expiration under the terms of the trust typically occurs when a terminating event defined in the instrument transpires. Common terminating events include:• Age. Termination may occur when one or all of the beneficiaries attain a specified age. Age-based termination is particularly useful for parents and older relatives who wish to leave bequests to minor children or beneficiaries who are too young to manage a bequest prudently. An age-based termination protects minors from outright inheritance being subjected to guardianship provisions and allows time for beneficiaries to mature.• Death. Termination may occur when all or a specified beneficiary dies. This type of termination is useful in situations involving marital trusts, where upon a surviving spouse's death, a trust terminates with distributions to the couple's descendants. In the case of pet trusts under Section 53-12-28 of the Georgia Code, the trust terminates upon the death of the last surviving animal-beneficiary. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-28(a).• Contingent term completed. Termination may occur upon completion of a specified trust term upon which termination is contingent. As a trust may be established for any legal purpose, the settlor has a broad range of contingent termination events available. Completion of college or vocational school is one common contingent termination event employed by parents establishing trusts for children or grandchildren. Another increasingly common contingent termination event is a beneficiary's sobriety. Settlors may wish to include contingent termination language based on the beneficiary becoming sober. The practitioner should be careful to address all aspects of this issue, such as the potential for relapse, and how and by whom sobriety is determined.Counsel is advised to draft thorough termination provisions to account for a wide array of circumstances.Termination of Irrevocable Trust by ConsentDuring the settlor's lifetime, a court may, upon petition, terminate an irrevocable trust under Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(b). If the court finds that the settlor and all beneficiaries consent and proper notice was given to the trustee, the court may approve the termination even if it is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(b). In the event that the settlor is still living but unable to consent to such termination, the settlor's power to consent to termination may be exercised by:• An agent under a power of attorney, only to the extent expressly authorized by the power of attorney and the terms of the trust• The settlor's conservator, with the approval of the court supervising the conservatorship if an agent is not so authorized• The settlor's guardian, with the approval of the court supervising the guardianship if an agent is not so authorized and a conservator has not been appointedGa. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(b)(1)–(3).Following the settlor's death, the court may terminate an irrevocable trust under Section 53-12-61(c). The trust may be terminated if the court finds that:• All of the beneficiaries' consent to the termination• The trustee has received notice of the proposed termination –and–• The court concludes that continuance of such trust is not necessary to achieve any material purpose of such trustGa. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(c)(2). If the client anticipates his or her power of attorney agent exercising the settlor's powers under the trust instrument, counsel must ensure that the authorization for such exercise of power is present in the power of attorney instrument as well as the trust instrument. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(b)(1).Termination Due to Cost of AdministrationUpon petition, the court may terminate a trust and order the distribution of the trust property if the costs of administration are such that the continuance of the trust, the establishment of the trust if it is to be established, or the distribution from a probate estate would defeat or substantially impair the purposes of the trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(6)(A).Termination Based on PurposeUpon petition, the court may terminate a trust and order the distribution of the trust property if the purpose of the trust has:• Been fulfilled• Become illegal to fulfill –or–• Become impossible to fulfillGa. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(d)(6)(B).Termination Due to ImpairmentUpon petition, the court may terminate a trust and order the distribution of the trust property if the continuance of such trust would impair the accomplishments of the trust's purposes. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61(c)(6)(C).Termination of Uneconomical TrustWhen the value of the trust property is under $100,000 or the trustee's annual fee exceeds 5% of the market value of the principal assets, the trustee can terminate the trust if he or she concludes that the value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration. The trustee must notify the qualified beneficiaries prior to termination. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-65(a). The court may also terminate a trust—or remove the trustee and appoint a different one—if the court determines that the value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the administration cost. Ga Code Ann. § 53-12-65(b). If a trust is terminated under Section 53-12-65(a), the trustee must distribute the trust property in a manner consistent with the purposes of the trust. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-65(c).Sections 53-12-65(a)–(b) do not apply to an easement for conservation or to trusts governed by Chapter 14 of Title 10 of the Georgia Code pertaining to cemetery and funeral services. Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-65(d) and 65(e).Practice ConsiderationsAmendment, revocation, and termination must also be considered in the context of practice. Estate planning practitioners are frequently faced with conflicts of interest, undue influence, and issues concerning capacity. These situations are especially common for the estate planner who drafts trusts and who may be asked to represent multiple parties with different roles pertaining to the instrument.The estate planner will in all likelihood be asked to represent settlors, beneficiaries, trustees, or any combination of individuals involved with the trust. When undertaking representation of these multiple parties, the practitioner must be aware of potential ethical pitfalls.Duty of LoyaltyLoyalty and independent judgment are essential elements of the lawyer's relationship to a client. See Ga. R. Prof Conduct 1.7 Cmt. 1. Loyalty to a client encompasses prohibitions against representing clients who have directly adverse interests. Within the meaning of Rule 1.7(a), the representation of one client is impaired by the representation of another client "when a lawyer cannot consider, recommend, or carry out an appropriate course of action for the client because of the lawyer's other competing responsibilities or interests." See Ga. R. Prof Conduct 1.7 Cmt. 2. Consider the following examples of the role of the duty of loyalty in estate planning practice:• Example 1. The estate planner is approached by the remainder beneficiary, who wishes to retain the estate planner to seek to terminate the trust under Ga. Code Ann. § 53-12-61. May the estate planner represent the remainder beneficiary? In all likelihood, no. If the remainder beneficiary is seeking termination in contradiction of the trust instrument or the settlor's interests, a conflict of interest violating the duty of loyalty would likely be created.• Example 2. The estate planner drafted an irrevocable trust for the settlor. The estate planner is later approached by the trustee, who requests the estate planner draft a Certification of Trust for the trustee's use. May the estate planner draft the requested document for the trustee without creating a conflict of interest that violates the duty of loyalty to the settlor? In all likelihood, yes. The trustee's request for a Certification of Trust does not conflict with the settlor's interests and likely aids the trustee in fulfilling the settlor's intentions under the trust.As a best practice, the estate planner should not undertake the type of representation in either example until the settlor or the settlor's agent has provided consent under Ga. R. Prof Conduct 1.7(b).Incapacity and Undue InfluenceEqually important to the estate planning practitioner are the issues of client incapacity and undue influence. Settlors, trustees, and beneficiaries are all subject to possible legal incapacity or lack of free will. For example, an incapacitated settlor may wish to amend the terms of a trust to conform with a delusion caused by the incapacity. Or the assertion of undue influence may persuade a settlor to revoke a trust against the settlor's own best interests. The estate planner must proceed cautiously when presented with a situation involving a potentially compromised individual in order to adhere to standards of professional conduct, and to best advise the parties with regard to the settlor's intentions and the trust purposes.For an in-depth discussion of the ethical issues involved in estate planning, see Ethical Issues in Estate Planning (GA), 2 Georgia Estate Planning § 14.1, 1 Tax, Estate & Financial Planning for the Elderly § 18.04, and 1 Tax, Estate & Financial Planning for the Elderly § 18.06.Current as of: 09/18/2024End of Document

Letter to Client 
[Month] [Day], [Year][name of client][address of client]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client]:Now that you have established your Revocable Trust (the "Trust"), you should fund it by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. An unfunded or partially funded trust will not avoid probate. While your pour-over will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the Trust and distributed as provided therein, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the Trust. To avoid that result and any attendant delays, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Trust as further outlined in this letter.Please review your assets to determine which to transfer into your Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Generally, certain assets should not be transferred to the trust during your lifetime, for example, IRAs and certain types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trust, you will need to change the title for each asset from your name individually to the Revocable Trust. This may require you to execute new documents of title, deeds to real property, and signature cards for your bank accounts. We prefer the following format for titling assets in the name of your Trust:[Name of client], as Trustee of the [name of revocable trust] dated [month] [day], [year], and any amendments thereto.We recommend you keep copies of all written documents which evidence the ownership interest of your Trust. Additionally, it is good practice to keep a list of all assets transferred to the Trust, along with the date of transfer, on Schedule A of the Trust.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own name (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, or if you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office.Instructions for Transferring Specific AssetsCash AccountsYou should sign new signature and ownership cards to retitle any sizeable bank accounts or cash equivalents, including treasury bills, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, to name yourself as Trustee of those accounts. You need not change any small joint or other checking accounts used primarily for household expenses.Before you retitle your certificates of deposit, consult with a bank officer to make sure that the institution does not consider the change in account name to be an early withdrawal that incurs a penalty. Generally, this should not be a problem because your tax identification number for the account will remain the same.Instruct your financial institution by letter or in person to change the title to your Trust. The tax identification number (your Social Security number) on the account for withholding and reporting purposes will remain the same. Sign the new signature cards as Trustee.Investment AccountsIf you hold publicly traded stocks and bonds through brokerage or investment accounts, contact your brokers or custodians and direct them to change the title of the accounts to the name of your Trust. The procedure for doing so is the same as the procedure for retitling cash accounts explained above. You may have to complete new account applications and present a copy of your Trust Agreement or Certification of Trust in order to change the title. Title to the accounts should be in the trust name.Stocks and Bonds Not Held in Investment AccountsIf you possess original stock or bond certificates, new certificates may be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. Alternatively, you may open a brokerage or investment account in the name of your Revocable Trust and deposit your original certificates in the account.Personal EffectsTangible personal property refers to such items as household furnishings, appliances and fixtures, works of art, motor vehicles, pictures, collectibles, personal wearing apparel and jewelry, books, sporting goods, and hobby paraphernalia. You can transfer your tangible personal property by executing an Assignment of Personal Property.Your personal vehicles can be titled in the name of your Revocable Trust, but we find that most of our clients prefer to leave their vehicles outside their trust. However, should you decide to title your vehicle in the name of the Trust, consult your casualty insurance agent and advise them of the change.Retirement Plans, Life Insurance Policies, and AnnuitiesGenerally speaking, ownership of these accounts should not be transferred to your Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the Trust. Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, you may wish to transfer ownership to your Trust to give the Trustee more control over the policies in case you become disabled. Alternatively, you may want the proceeds from the policies paid directly to your Revocable Trust. In order to designate the Trust as the owner and/or beneficiary, you will need to obtain and complete Change of Ownership and/or Change of Beneficiary forms. Your agent should be able to assist you with naming the Trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of the policy, or if not, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you. You should receive a letter confirming the change of beneficiary from the insurance company to keep with your trust records.Ownership of IRAs should not be transferred to the trust. Designating the Trust as beneficiary of an annuity or retirement account may have unintended income tax consequences. Please contact me or your tax professional prior to making any such designation.Real PropertyTransferring real property to your trust will require attention to ownership and tax issues based on the nature of the current title to the property. You will need to execute new deeds for each property. At your request, we will assist you with the transfer of the property located in New Jersey.Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger a "due on sale" clause in the instrument. If there is an open mortgage of record, you should obtain the bank's consent prior to executing and recording the deed.You should contact your homeowner's insurance provider to discuss adding your Trust as an additional insured on your policy. Further, you may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the transfer to the Trust will not void the title policy.Administering the TrustIf a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Revocable Trust to complete the transfer, use the Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire trust agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually. For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.As long as you are living, you do not need to obtain a separate tax identification number for your trust or to file a separate trust tax return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prefers that you use your own Social Security number. You should report all of the income generated by trust assets on your personal IRS Form 1040.When you die, your trust becomes irrevocable and the successor trustee will need to obtain a tax identification number. We will work with your successor trustee and your accountant to see that your heirs get the full benefit of your estate planning upon your death.You should review your estate plan with an attorney every two to three years because all estate plans require on-going maintenance. In particular, a change in your family circumstances, an increase in your net worth, or a change in the tax law could significantly impact the effectiveness of your plan.I hope that this letter answers most, if not all, of your immediate questions. Please call me if you have any additional questions about the transfer of property to your Trust or about the operation of the Trust in the future. At death, certain trust administration procedures will be required, and it is advisable for the successor trustee to consult with an attorney at that time. This letter is for your guidance only and does not discuss all possible situations. Please keep it for future reference.____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Funding Revocable Trusts
Go to: How to Transfer or Place Specific Assets into a Revocable Living Trust   |   Other Funding IssuesMaintainedThis practice note contains information and instructions on how to fund a revocable trust. It is intended to be a general overview and is not tailored to any particular state law. You should review your applicable state's law for particular information and instructions as it may differ from these general instructions.One of the primary benefits of a revocable living trust is that, if fully and properly funded during the grantor's lifetime, probate can be avoided. Therefore, it is vitally important to transfer all of a grantor's assets into the trust, ideally soon after the creation of the trust, and then on an ongoing basis as needed throughout the grantor's lifetime. This practice note offers guidance to you when funding a revocable living trust for your clients, as well as when advising your clients as to how they should fund it.Trust funding must be taken seriously and professionally, as errors can result in an ineffective estate plan, client complaints, and malpractice claims. Some attorneys choose not to involve themselves in the funding process. Others assume responsibility for certain tasks and not for others. To the extent possible, you should determine with your client in advance who will be responsible for which tasks and clearly explain that all tasks other than those you expressly agree to undertake will be the responsibility of the client unless you subsequently agree otherwise (ideally in writing). In situations where the client is to perform some or all funding tasks, you may wish to send a follow-up/reminder letter approximately 60 days after the trust is created to reiterate the importance of funding the trust and to see if they wish to involve your help with any remaining tasks. If you choose not to take on the responsibility of funding the trust for your client, or if the client declines your offer to help, you should at least provide explicit instructions about the process to the client.A grantor's assets must be transferred into the trust if the trust is to achieve its objectives. An essential objective of the trust is to simplify the transfer and administration of assets upon the grantor's incapacity and after the grantor's death. Funding is necessary because the trustee only has control of the property if it is held in the trust. If the grantor becomes incapacitated, the chosen successor trustee(s) will be able to continue managing trust assets without court involvement or other difficulty if the grantor's assets are in the trust at that time.To the extent that the grantor does not transfer assets into the trust or otherwise provide for their transfer upon death through beneficiary designation or similar forms, those assets will not escape probate. That is why a pour-over will should always be prepared along with the trust agreement to direct that any assets not held by the trust at the time of the grantor's death be transferred into the trust so that they will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the trust. However, a probate proceeding will be necessary to accomplish this. See Modern Estate Planning § 37.26 for additional information.For a full listing of key content related to estate plans, see Estate Planning Essentials Resource Kit.For related practice notes, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts and Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration.For more discussion of funding of revocable trusts, see Modern Estate Planning §§ 37.25, 26, and 28, and Living Trusts: Forms and Practice § 7.02–7.07.How to Transfer or Place Specific Assets into a Revocable Living TrustThe grantor must assign each titled asset separately into the name of the revocable trust to ensure that the transfer of those assets has legal effect. Certain assets may need special consideration as to whether they should be transferred to the trust. Funding a trust is a multistep process, as summarized in the below image.Visualization of Revocable Trust Drafting and Funding Flowchart.The assets discussed below are commonly held by a grantor. You should be mindful to get a clear and accurate picture of the types of assets your client owns so you can provide appropriate advice and try to ensure everything that must be transferred to the trust gets transferred.Personal ResidenceIn most cases, the grantor's interest in their home should be transferred from their own name to the name of the trustee (usually, the client is the trustee). Recording a deed and filing any necessary transfer tax forms (if applicable in the client's jurisdiction) will achieve this purpose. For a modest fee, a title insurance company or attorney can help make sure everything is done properly and efficiently. If the client undertakes this task, you should ask to be sent a copy of the recorded deed.A few special points about the transfer of a residence or any other real property into a revocable living trust:• There should be no reassessment of property taxes because the transfer of real property to a revocable trust is not a "change in ownership" for property tax purposes. The beneficial owner is still the grantor. However, you should confirm this is the case in the applicable state.• There should be no transfer tax because there has been no transfer of beneficial interest. Typically, for transfer tax to apply, there needs to be a transfer of beneficial interest. However, depending on your jurisdiction, appropriate transfer tax forms may need to be filed, indicating that it is a transfer for no consideration to a revocable trust.• While it is not legally required that the new deed be recorded right away, it is highly advisable to do so unless the terms of any mortgage contain language that makes it unwise. For example, most mortgage agreements have what is called an acceleration or "due on sale" clause, which means that the full balance on the mortgage becomes immediately due if there is a change in ownership. Since transferring the home into the trust is not a change of ownership of the type a due on sale clause is meant to address, you or the client should contact the lender, explain what you are trying to do, and confirm that the due on sale clause will not be triggered. See 12 U.S.C. § 1701j-3(d)(8). Whenever possible, you or the client should get this in writing from the lender.Cooperative or Condominium ApartmentsIf the client has such an ownership interest in a cooperative or condominium, you or the client should ask the manager of the cooperative or condominium about how it should be transferred into the trust. It is likely the management will have various formalities and fees associated with the transfer, but it is nevertheless important that the transfer be made. You should try to explain that this is not an actual transfer of beneficial ownership and that fees or certain formalities need not or should not apply, but the ultimate decision will rest with the cooperative or condominium.Please also note that if the client chooses to refinance their mortgage after transferring the cooperative apartment or condominium into the trust, they may have to transfer it out of the trust first in order to refinance due to the mortgage company's requirement, and then transfer it back into the trust after the refinance is complete. You or the client should always consult with the lender when making these types of changes to ensure compliance with the terms of the loan agreement.Other Real PropertyA new deed is required for every other piece of real property that the client owns. As noted above, it may be necessary to obtain the permission of the lender to transfer the property into the trust. If the other real property is located in another state, you or the client should consult an attorney in that state to assist in transferring that property, as different states have different rules and customs, especially as it pertains to deed formalities and requirements. If your client purchases real estate in the future, they should generally take title in their trustee capacity from the beginning. Often, clients obtain the real estate in their name and then ask the attorney to help them transfer it to their trust. If the client fails to transfer such new real property into the trust before death, the new real property must go through the probate process.Savings Accounts and Certificates of DepositThese accounts should be held by the trustee as trustee of the revocable trust. Banks and similar institutions commonly see revocable trusts and are used to helping their customers with necessary changes. A copy of the trust instrument or a Certificate of Trust (also referred to as Certification of Trust in some states) is usually required as proof that the trust exists. The Certificate of Trust provides the information necessary to identify the trust, including the grantor's name, the trustee's name, the trust's address, the date the trust was created, and the trustee's powers. See Certificate of Trust (NY) for a sample certificate of trust template. Suggest that the bank make a copy if they require it for their records. The client should keep a copy of any new card or document that they sign to effect the change. If a particular savings account cannot be transferred before a set date without losing interest, the client may decide to wait. It may be necessary to wait until a Certificate of Deposit's maturity date before it can be retitled to avoid any penalties. For a non-jurisdictional letter directing the transfer of accounts to a revocable trust, see Letter to Financial Institution (Transfer of Accounts to Revocable Trust).Checking AccountsWhile such accounts can and, in almost all cases, should be put into the name of the trust, the client may want, for a special reason, to leave one account in their name individually. One such reason could be that the client pays all of their bills using that account and transferring it to the trust would require new checkbooks and notifying each accountholder to update their records. However, any such account should maintain a low balance to the extent possible. Bank records must indicate that accounts are held in the name of the trust, but personal checks can be printed with the client's name only, without reference to the trust.Life Insurance PoliciesYou or the client must contact their insurance agent or the company itself to obtain their "Change of Beneficiary" and "Change of Ownership" forms. In many cases, the owner and the beneficiary should be the trust. You could make a trust the owner of an existing policy. To transfer an existing policy, you would have to contact the insurance company and comply by its requirements. Most often, in the case of an existing policy, the grantor makes the trust the beneficiary upon the grantor's death. If the grantor desires the insurance proceeds to be managed a certain way or to be distributed to specific beneficiaries unlike the other assets held in the trust, then the specifics in regard to such insurance policy should be clearly spelled out in the trust document. You or the client should take care to make the transfer of the life insurance policy or to designate the trust as its beneficiary as soon as possible. Be sure to receive written confirmation from the insurance company that the desired changes have been effected in company records and by endorsement on the policy. If not, you or the client should follow up periodically until the company sends confirmation of such change. See Modern Estate Planning § 37.17 for additional information.If the client has personal reasons for naming a particular individual as beneficiary instead of the trust, they certainly may do so. This means that the proceeds of the policy will be distributed directly to the named beneficiaries, and not according to the terms of the trust. There are differing opinions and considerations on whether to name individuals or the trust as the primary beneficiary of life insurance policies, and these opinions and considerations should be discussed with the client to determine the primary beneficiary of such policies. For example, if the client wants an outright distribution of insurance proceeds to a named beneficiary who is an adult and feels that person should have access to those proceeds quickly, then naming the individual as a beneficiary instead of the trust might be advisable. Also, while creditors often can go after insurance proceeds to satisfy any debts of the deceased grantor, it is perhaps less likely that will happen if the proceeds pay out directly to a named beneficiary as opposed to them being paid out to the trust.Insurance on Property Held by the TrustInsurance contracts that provide for payments to be made if there is loss or damage to assets held in trust (e.g., title insurance and homeowner's insurance) should be amended. You or the client should ask their insurance agent to have the policy or policies amended. The trustee(s) and the trust should be named as additional insured parties, using the "name" suggested under Other Funding Issues below.The grantor, as an individual, should continue to be named as an insured party even though the trust and trustee are added as additional insured parties.Stock/SecuritiesThe transfer of stock to the trust must be accomplished by changing title on the stock certificates themselves. The client's broker can help make this change for free or for a small charge per certificate. If your client holds shares through a brokerage firm, the client will need to change the title on only the brokerage accounts, rather than on each share certificate.The stockbroker may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers should be sufficient to demonstrate that the trust is properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. Alternatively, you or the client may be able to simply provide a copy of the Certificate of Trust or equivalent document.If the client holds shares in a closely held corporation, the corporation's secretary should issue new certificates in the name of the trust. The existing (old) certificates should then be canceled. Before this is done, however, it should be determined whether there is a stock restriction agreement, whether an assignment might cause some sort of forfeiture, and whether the board must approve the transfer. It would be wise to consult with corporate counsel in this regard.You or the client should send any stock certificates via registered mail, return receipt requested, with enough insurance to cover the replacement bond, in case the certificates are lost in the mail. The amount of this bond can be obtained from the brokerage, and it guards against someone else trying to transfer the certificates if they somehow fall into someone else's hands.PartnershipsPartnership interests can be complicated. A limited partnership agreement may indicate what is needed to transfer the interest. Such an agreement should be reviewed to determine (1) whether or not the client can transfer their interest into the trust and, if so, (2) how to achieve this result. See Modern Estate Planning § 37.20 for additional information.Limited Liability CompaniesLimited liability companies are similar to closely held corporations and partnerships. Instead of ''shares'' or ''stock,'' the owners of a limited liability company own ''membership units'' or ''membership interests.'' Different states may refer to such ownership using different terms. They can involve certificates, which would have to be transferred in the same way as a corporation's certificate. They can also have a membership interest restriction agreement in place, which can restrict the transfer of membership units similar to a stock restriction agreement. A limited liability company's operating agreement, which is similar to the partnership agreement, could also provide for restrictions on the transfer of membership units.Promissory NotesThe client should assign each promissory note owned to the trust. The client can do so by typing on the back of each note the following endorsement:Pay to the order of ______________________, Trustee under ______________________ Trust Agreement Dated ______________________ ______________________.Go to table1The client should also assign the deeds of trust securing payment of the notes to the trust. You or the client need not record the assignment, but it should be prepared in the same manner as deeds to real property and should be retained in a safe place. If the trustee or a successor trustee needs to commence any action to obtain title to the property given as the security for payment of the note, the assignment can be recorded. For a non-jurisdictional promissory note assignment template, see Assignment of Unsecured Promissory Note to Revocable Trust.Alternatively, the client could sign an ''Allonge'' to the promissory note if allowed under the applicable jurisdiction, which is a simple declaration of assignment.IRAsIRAs must be held in the name of the individual who created the account and their ownership cannot be changed. The client can only name beneficiaries on a "designation of beneficiary" form provided by the financial institution. Normally, a married person will name their spouse as the first beneficiary (because the spouse can roll over the IRA into their own IRA on the client's death), and, as alternate beneficiary, either the trust or individuals. Individuals as beneficiaries may have a few more tax elections than the trust will have. Naming the trust as beneficiary will have less such options, but would ensure that the proceeds of the account pay to beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the trust.Retirement BenefitsRetirement benefits require special consideration since both the form of benefit and the choice of beneficiary affect the client's estate plan and can have significant tax consequences. These choices also have a major impact on married persons' lives in the event one spouse enters a nursing home. The client should consult with the plan administrator about the options available now and in the future. The necessary forms may require specific wording in order for your married clients to be eligible for the marital deduction and other benefits.If your client's employment terminated before 1985, they may be entitled to certain important tax advantages. The client should review their benefits with a pension specialist prior to making any changes to the retirement benefits.Normally a married client should first designate their spouse as the beneficiary of qualified plan benefits.AutomobilesIt may not be advisable to transfer automobiles to the trust. If, however, your client has a number of automobiles, or ones of particularly high value, these should be transferred to the trust. Automobiles should not be transferred to the trust unless the client is certain that adequate liability insurance is available to cover substantial claims, as the trust may be made a party to any lawsuits following an accident involving an automobile that the trust holds as the owner. If automobiles are to be transferred to the trust, your client should contact the appropriate state licensing agency for the vehicle and seek instructions on how to effectuate the transfer of title to the trust. Further, your client should also contact the insurance carrier for the vehicle to ensure the vehicle will continue to be covered once it is placed in the trust.Lease AgreementsThe lease under which your client is the lessor should be assigned to the trust using an Assignment of Lease or similar document that effectuates the assignment. Your client should notify the lessee in writing that all future rental checks should be made payable directly to the trust, not to your client individually.Cemetery PlotsYou or the client should transfer their cemetery plot to the trust. This is typically done through executing an Assignment of Burial Plots & Mausoleum or similar document that effectuates the transfer. The director of the cemetery should receive a copy of this Assignment. Perhaps the organization that sold the client the cemetery plot also has assignment forms that they could provide.Safe Deposit BoxYour client can transfer their safe deposit box by assigning the rights under the existing rental agreement to the trust or by having the trust itself enter into a new rental agreement with the bank. It is also a good idea for your client to give the successor trustee authority to access the box so that if your client should become incapacitated or even deceased, the successor trustee can get into the box.U.S. Savings BondsThe federal government requires the use of Form PD 1851 for transferring U.S. Savings Bonds. The back of the form has instructions. After you or the client have filled out the form, the client's signature must be "guaranteed" (medallion stamped) by an officer at their bank and forwarded along with the bonds to the following. For EE or I savings bonds: Treasury Retail Securities Services, PO Box 214, Minneapolis, MN 55480-0214; for HH savings bonds: Treasury Retail Securities Services, PO Box 2186, Minneapolis, MN 55480-2186.Other Personal PropertyProperty such as airplanes, yachts, horses, artwork, copyrights, patents, or royalty contracts, a family business, stock options, mobile homes, partnership interests, and other rare types of property have special considerations that should be researched to determine if and how to transfer such property into the trust.Personal property items (household furniture and furnishings, books, pictures, jewelry, hobby equipment and collections, wearing apparel, and other articles of household or personal use or ornament, etc.) can be transferred by a general assignment with particular descriptions of valuable items and a provision to cover after-acquired items.Other Funding IssuesIn What "Name" Should Trust Assets Be Held?Generally speaking, assets will be retitled in substantially the following format:[Trustee name], Trustee under [trust name] Trust Agreement Dated [month day, year].This ensures that the appropriate trust is the owner of the property. Not using all these identification markers can lead to ambiguities. There could be two or more trusts with the same name, or on the same date, but it is very unlikely that two trusts exist with the same trustee, name, and date of signing. It presents no problems if a bank or any other financial institution wants to hold an asset in a slightly different name. The important thing is to be sure that the trust is not confused with any other trust and that the assets are clearly held in the trust.Income Tax ReturnsAt the time the trust is established, your client should inform their accountant.As long as the grantor serves as the trustee (which is usually the case), they will use their social security number as the number for the trust. Your client will file the same income tax return they have always filed. If a successor trustee takes over, a tax identification number must be obtained so that the trust can file an income tax return. The trust will, in effect, file a return with the same information and pay no more taxes than your client pays now, but the information will be reported on an IRS form designed for trustees and fiduciaries.The successor trustee will use IRS Form SS-4 to obtain the new tax identification number. When the number is received, it should be communicated to the client's accountant or tax preparer, as it will be used on the tax return to be signed by the trustee.RecordkeepingNo extraordinary recordkeeping is necessary beyond that which your client would ordinarily maintain. It is important, however, that the client keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. Once changes in ownership to the trust are made, your client will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust. Information your client receives from their stockbroker or other sources of financial information should also be adequate.Preparation of Schedule AYou or your client should prepare a Schedule A listing all assets transferred to the trust. Examples of these listings are:• 100 shares, P, G & E, common• Real property at 0000 High Street, Palo Alto, California –and–• Limited partnership interest in XXX Fund 1 unitFuture Changes in Trust AssetsIf the trust should subsequently dispose of a listed asset, it may be removed from the schedule by keeping a separate schedule and indicating its disposition and the date it was disposed of. Schedule A as originally prepared need not be changed, as it only indicates assets as of a particular day. As assets are removed, your client should simply keep a record of the change. Likewise, if a new asset is acquired by the trust, it may be added to a new schedule.The client should review the schedule of trust assets each year when income tax returns are prepared. Delete what has been sold. Add what has been acquired and confirm that it is held in the name of the trust.Future Trust AdministrationThe focus at the time the trust is created is funding the trust and administering it during your client's lifetime. At death, certain trust administrative procedures are required, and consultation by the successor trustee with an attorney will likely be necessary. If the trust has been properly funded, the cost of trust administration will be significantly less than probate. Furthermore, if the trust contains provisions for an A/B trust, significant tax savings and other benefits are likely. You may also wish to suggest that your client create a list of their professional advisers (e.g., you, their financial planner, their CPA/tax preparer, etc.), as well as the institutions holding the grantor's assets—along with contact information for each—and keep it with their trust records. This can be of great benefit to successor trustees who may not be familiar with the grantor's assets and who to contact about those assets.Current as of: 01/10/2025

Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (MI)
Go to: What Is a Trust?   |   Characteristics of a TrustMaintainedby Dustin S. Foster and Sara A. SchimkeThis practice note discusses characteristics of trusts in Michigan. It provides a definition of the term and identifies certain distinctions in terminology used, as well as types of trusts and certain characteristics of trusts. It addresses the types of trusts and certain characteristics of trusts, including bifurcation of property ownership, trustee’s powers and duties, trust interpretation, and revocable versus irrevocable trusts.For more information on revoking, amending, or termination a trust, see Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (MI).What Is a Trust?Effective April 1, 2010, Article VII of Estates and Protected Individuals Code (EPIC) became the Michigan Trust Code (MTC). With the exception of a few sections, the MTC applies to all trusts created either before or after the effective date. The code provides a new level of consistency when it comes to the creation, administration, and termination of trusts in Michigan. The following is a discussion and analysis of the major portions of the MTC.While the MTC is new, the definition of a trust has not changed.“Trust” includes, but is not limited to, an express trust, private or charitable, with additions to the trust, wherever and however created …. Trust does not include a constructive trust or a resulting trust, conservatorship, personal representative, custodial arrangement under the Michigan uniform transfers to minors act, 1998 PA 433, MCL 554.521 to 554.552, business trust providing for a certificate to be issued to a beneficiary, Yu trust fund, voting trust, security arrangement, liquidation trust, or trust for the primary purpose of paying debts, dividends, interest, … or another arrangement under which a person is a nominee or escrowee for another.MCL 700.1107(n).The MTC has added a few new terms to the trust vocabulary in Michigan. Namely, the MTC now defines charitable trust (MCL 700.7103 (c)), discretionary trust (MCL 700.7103(d)), interests of the beneficiaries (MCL 700.7103(e)), qualified trust beneficiary (MCL 700.7103 (g)), revocable (MCL 700.7103 (h)), support provision (MCL 700.7103 (k)), and trust director (MCL 700.7103(m) and MCL 700.7703a). Almost all other terms dealing with trust can be found at the beginning of EPIC, MCL 700.1103 through MCL 700.1108.Bifurcation of Property OwnershipMost trusts created for estate planning purposes are express trusts governed by written declarations of trust (or, in the case of a testamentary trust, the terms of the trust are contained in the terms of the testator’s will); however, the MTC recognizes oral trusts under MCL 700.7407. The fundamental principles of a trust remain the same: when a trust is created, the settlor splits legal and equitable title between a trustee and a beneficiary respectively. See MCL 700.7401(1). Without a split in the title, there is no trust. The MTC has codified common law with regard to the requirements for the creation of a valid trust: the settlor must have capacity to create the trust (MCL 700.7402(1)(a)), intent to create a trust (MCL 700.7402(1)(b)), and an ascertainable beneficiary (MCL 700.7402(1)(c) and (2)); the trustee must have duties to perform (MCL 700.7402(1)(d)); and the sole beneficiary cannot be the sole trustee (MCL 700.7402). Contrary to common law, the trust does not require the transfer of res or trust property to the trustee concurrently with the signing of the trust instrument to be valid (see MCL 700.7401(2)). Furthermore, the MTC recognizes the existence of oral trusts established by “clear and convincing evidence.” See MCL 700.7407.The requisite mental capacity to create a trust is the same as that to create a valid will (MCL 700.7601). Therefore, in order to create a valid trust, the settlor must understand that the trust will distribute property after his or her death (MCL 700.2501(2)(a)), understand the “nature and extent” of his or her property (MCL 700.2501(2)(b)), know the “natural objects of his or her bounty” (MCL 700.2501(2)(c)), and have “the ability to understand in a reasonable matter the general nature and effect of his or her … signing the [trust]” (MCL 700.2501(2)(d)). The lack of mental capacity does not preclude the creation of a trust so long as a properly appointed agent is given the power to create a trust on behalf of an incapacitated settlor. See Reporter’s Comment to MCL 700.7402. All trusts created after April 1, 2010, are presumed to be revocable unless stated otherwise by the settlor. MCL 700.7602(1).Trust and Trust AgreementTrusteesTrustees’ powers and duties are detailed in Part 7 of the MTC. As with most sections in EPIC and the MTC, the rules set forth for the trustee are default provisions which can be modified by the declaration of trust with the exception of the following: the trust document cannot modify a trustee’s duty of loyalty and care as defined in Section?7801 (MCL 700.7105(2)(b)), the court still has the power to determine the necessity of bond (MCL 700.7105(2)(f)) and determine the reasonableness of the trustee’s compensation and make required adjustments (MCL 700.7105(2)(g)), the trustee is still required to “provide beneficiaries with the terms of the trust” and other necessary information as stated in Section?7814 (MCL 700.7105(2)(i)), and the trust document cannot eliminate the power of a court to order trustee accountings (MCL 700.7105(2)(j)).A cotrustee, qualified beneficiary, or the settlor may petition for the removal of a trustee (MCL 700.7706(1)). And the court may remove a trustee for various acts or failure to act, including a “lack of cooperation” between cotrustees (MCL 700.7706(2)(b)), “persistent failure” to perform his duties (MCL 700.7706(2)(c)), or a “substantial change of circumstances” (MCL 700.7706(2)(d)). A trustee is entitled to reasonable compensation (MCL 700.7708(1)), and reimbursement of expenses “properly incurred in the administration of the trust” (MCL 700.7709(1)(a)).The trustee must “administer the trust in good faith … in accordance with its terms … for the benefit of the trust beneficiaries.” See MCL 700.7801. The trustee’s duty of loyalty is set forth in MCL 700.7802 which codifies the traditional sense of a fiduciary’s duty of loyalty: the trustee must administer the trust for the benefit of the trust beneficiaries and no one else (MCL 700.7802(1)). With regard to the duty of care that must be followed by a trustee, the MTC refers to the Michigan prudent investor rule and follows a prudent person standard. Furthermore, the code states that if a trustee has special skills and was named trustee “on the basis of representation of [those] skills,” the trustee is expected to use those special skills (MCL 700.7803). Therefore, if your client names her nephew to act as her trustee because her nephew is an attorney, the nephew is expected to exercise a level of care normally associated with an attorney.Under MCL 700.7401(2), until property or an interest in property is transferred to the trustee or made subject to the terms of the trust, the person nominated as trustee has no fiduciary or other obligations under the instrument establishing the terms of the trust except as may have been specifically agreed by the settlor and the nominated trustee.Effective March 29, 2019, Michigan adopted the Michigan’s directed trust and divided trustee laws. Codified at MCL 700.7703a and MCL 700.7703b, the laws are based on the Uniform Directed Trust Act.Administration of the trust generally rests in the settlor and/or trustee, or another person delegated by the trustee. In 2019, Michigan law adopted the concept of the role of the trust director, which is someone other than the settlor or trustee who has the power to make decisions regarding some part of the administration of the trust (MCL 700.7703a). A trust director must be either a natural person or an organization permitted to exercise trust powers. See MCL 700.7703a(23)(f). The extent to which a trust director can determine the administration of the trust is set forth by the settlor. The settlor and drafter must carefully consider the powers and responsibilities given to the trust director as this individual is a fiduciary and could face liability if his or her role and responsibilities are not carefully described. Even if the settlor does not use the title trust director in his or her declaration of trust, a court may in fact determine that an individual is a trust director by virtue of his or her responsibilities to the trust.An unpublished 2023 decision from the Michigan Court of Appeals presents an interesting situation involving the administration of a trust by a future trustee and beneficiary while the settlor/trustee was still alive. In In re Esther Kratzer Revocable Trust & In re Wendell Kratzer Revocable Trust, Michigan Court of Appeals, Dkt. Nos. 357860, 357861 (Mar 23, 2023) (unpublished), the settlor and trustee of a trust and successor trustee of his wife’s trust. The purpose of the trusts was the administration of the family farm and farm-related assets. The trustee nominated one of his four children to become the trustee of the trusts after his death. During the father’s lifetime, the son who was to become the trustee on the father’s death and who lived on the farm with his wife, made noticeable improvements to the farm property during his father’s lifetime. The father was in an assisted-living facility, but was not mentally incapacitated. Although the son made the decisions, all decisions were made in consultation with the father.In the original proceedings, the probate court held that the son and his wife were the only beneficiaries of the improvements that were made with the trust funds, and that he was required to pay the trust back for the cost of the improvements. Reversing the decision of the probate court, the appeals court held that because the father, who was mentally capable, was still the trustee when the improvements were made and because the father consented to the improvements, the improvements that were made were not a breach of the son’s fiduciary duty. The court found that the son owed these duties only to the father, and that, because the father had created the revocable trust, he could override the terms of the trust and give the son permission to make the improvements.The above case is, however, a cautionary tale as to the administration of a trust by someone other than the trustee. Although the son was going to become the trustee on his father’s death, he was, during the father’s lifetime, not able to act on his own. The appeals court based its decision largely on the competency of the settlor/trustee and the action of the son as his agent. The appeals court found that the son, as agent of his father, owed a fiduciary duty to his father, and not to the other beneficiaries.Interpretation of TrustsWith regard to interpretation of specific trust provisions, the MTC has again codified long-held common-law principals and added a few clarifications. This section will review some notable provisions in the area of trust interpretation.Spendthrift, support, and discretionary trusts receive essentially the same treatment under the code as they did in common law. Spendthrift provisions are valid and enforceable and they prevent “both voluntary and involuntary transfer of the trust beneficiary’s interest.” See MCL 700.7502(1) and (2). Support language will protect trust assets from creditors until it is distributed to the beneficiary. Once income or principal is distributed to a beneficiary, the beneficiary’s creditors may only attach to those amounts “not necessary for the health, education, support, or maintenance of the trust beneficiary.” Discretionary trusts are still the strongest protection against a beneficiary’s creditors in that no amount is available to creditors until the income or principal is distributed to the beneficiary (MCL 700.7505). In the event the settlor has created a hybrid trust such that the trustee has discretion to distribute income or principal for the beneficiary’s support, the trust will be treated as a discretionary trust and not a support trust (MCL 700.7103(k)).The MTC codifies the common-law treatment of the three special creditors: alimony and child support, support services creditors, and the state of Michigan or the United States. MCL 700.7504 specifically exempts these three categories of creditors when it comes to the application of spendthrift and support provisions in a trust. Therefore, a creditor of the beneficiary falling into one of the three mentioned categories can attach to the beneficiary’s interest in a trust, even though it is protected by a spendthrift or support provision, without having to wait for the income or principal to be distributed directly to the beneficiary.The rules of construction as applied to accessions, the presumption of non-ademption by extinction, ademption by satisfaction, and the presumption of non-exoneration are all applied to trusts in the same manner as they are applied to wills. MCL 700.2605 et seq. In terrorem clauses in trusts now have the same treatment as with wills. Therefore, a penalty clause in a trust will not be given effect if there is probable cause to bring the suit. MCL 700.7113.The doctrine of Cy pres is now codified in MCL 700.7413. Therefore, if a charitable trust becomes illegal or impossible to achieve and the court finds that the settlor had a general charitable intent, the court can modify the terms of the trust “in a manner consistent with the settlor’s general charitable intent.” MCL 700.7413. This version is entirely consistent with established common law. For more on this, see LaFond v City of Detroit, 357 Mich 362, 98 NW2d 530 (1959); In re Estate of Rood, 41 Mich App 405, 200 NW2d 728 (1972); Central United Methodist Church v Estes-Palmer Found (In re Estes Estate), 207 Mich App 194, 523 NW2d 863 (1994).Characteristics of a TrustRevocable or IrrevocableA revocable living trust arrangement offers several advantages during life and after death that are not available under a will alone:• During life, assets held under a revocable living trust agreement may be used for the benefit of an incapacitated settlor or his or her dependents. Assets may be deposited to the trust pursuant to the terms of a durable power of attorney or pursuant to court order. Thus, an ongoing, court-supervised conservatorship may be avoided.• After death, assets held in trust, payable to a trust, or “pouring over” to a trust pursuant to a will can be administered and distributed promptly, privately, and efficiently. To the extent, assets are held in trust or are payable directly to the trust at the settlor’s death, they are not subject to probate in Michigan or, generally, in other jurisdictions where they are situated. For example, insurance payable to the trustees of a living trust usually can be collected quickly upon presentation of a copy of the death certificate, the policy, and the trust agreement, and upon the signature of the trustee. If the same insurance were payable to a personal representative of a probate estate or to a testamentary trustee, before payment, the insurance company would require certified copies of letters of authority as evidence of a court’s appointment of the fiduciary. If the insurance were payable to a decedent’s estate, it would be subject to a probate court inventory fee; if payable to the trustee of a living trust, the probate fee is avoided. The trustee of a living trust, by contrast, generally may administer a trust without court supervision unless the trustee or a beneficiary requests probate court review. Indeed, a living trust arrangement may thwart court proceedings, such as a will contest or a spouse’s statutory election against a will.A revocable living trust can be explained to clients as an alternative means of holding title to property. Clients are familiar with holding assets in sole name or jointly with someone else. Assets titled in the name of a trustee are held according to the terms of a trust agreement which the client writes. If a client establishes a trust as settlor and trustee, the client retains full control over the trust terms and over any assets in the trust. If a client wishes to designate a third-party trustee or cotrustee, the client can have the benefit of the third party’s advice about the management of trust assets but can still retain control over trust terms and the trustee through powers of amendment, withdrawal, or removal of the third-party trustee.When should a trust be funded? A revocable living trust may be funded (1) during the Settlor’s lifetime, (2) by will, or (3) by other disposition taking effect upon the Settlor’s death. See MCL 700.7401(1)(a). Under Michigan law, an unfunded living trust agreement may be funded at death by assets pouring over from a decedent’s estate. MCL 700.2511. There should be no need to transfer funds to a trust when a trust agreement is signed unless the settlor derives some psychological comfort from establishing a trust “corpus” or unless a contest about settlor’s intent may be expected. The settlor may, however, wish to fund a trust during life to obtain professional investment assistance, to prepare for ease of administration if disability occurs, or to give future beneficiaries the comfort of knowing the arrangement for them is in place. Funding during life avoids the need to have assets probated even if settlor has a pour over will. If the assets are in the settlor’s name alone at his or her death, the property must go through the probate process to transfer title to the trustee.A living trust arrangement should not be oversold. A revocable trust does not afford protection against the settlor’s creditors, and trust assets are subject to federal estate tax.Current as of: 09/13/2024End of Document

Letter to Client 
Dear [name]:I am writing regarding the [name of beneficiary] Special Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year], which we have prepared for you as [settlor of the trust/trustee of the trust/both settlor and trustee of the trust].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust, and (2) address what you, as [settlor/trustee/both settlor and trustee] of the trust, need to know and think about while administering the trust. Therefore, I advise you to keep this letter for future reference.To accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the settlor and trustee must adhere to the terms of the trust agreement and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or a tax professional.The trust describes the responsibilities and the powers of the trustee(s). Since all trust documents (also called trust instruments) do not contain the same powers, the trustee must pay special attention to the language in the trust to be certain of the trustee's authority and options.This trust is a third-party special needs trust. It is designed so that the family and friends of [name of beneficiary], the beneficiary of the trust, can make gifts to benefit [name of beneficiary] while preserving the right to receive government benefits. There can be only one third-party special needs trust per beneficiary. It will be necessary that all friends and family wishing to make gifts to the beneficiary have the relevant information for this trust. The gifts made to the trust can take many forms: cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or even corporeal moveable property. Under no circumstances should any property or assets belonging to the beneficiary be transferred into the trust. If this is done, it could jeopardize the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. Also, the beneficiary has no right to demand or withdraw any assets or property from the trust.Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust. That means it is fixed and cannot be amended or terminated, except under very limited circumstances. Also, gifts made to the trust cannot be returned. Please call me if you need to make any changes to the trust.Federal Tax Identification Number. Whether or not the trust needs its own federal tax identification number (TIN) depends on whether the trust is a grantor trust or not. A grantor trust is a trust over which the grantor or other owner retains the power to control or direct the trust's income or assets. If the trust is a grantor trust, the trustee has the choice of reporting the annual income for federal tax purposes on either IRS Form 1041 or on the income tax return of the grantor. A grantor trust does not need its own TIN. If the trust is not a grantor trust, either the trustee or the attorney for the trust must obtain a TIN for the trust by filing IRS Form SS4. The TIN will be used to identify the trust in bank accounts and tax returns.Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the trust to be in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[name of trustee], Trustee of The [name of beneficiary] Special Needs Trust dated [month] [day], [year]." (Your bank may want to use a slightly different name.) If the trust is not a grantor trust, always use the trust's TIN as the identification number for bank accounts.Your stockbroker may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the Certification of Trust/Extract of Trustor the signature page and the trustee powers will demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business.To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded in the parish in which the real estate is situated granting the property to the trust. If there is more than one piece of real estate being transferred, it will be necessary to record the deed and Extract or Certification of Trust in each parish where the real estate is situated.Gift Tax Return. If any gift to the trust exceeds $19,000 in value, the donor should be instructed to complete a gift tax return (IRS Form 709) by April 15 of the following year. Please consult me concerning allocating some or all of your generation-skipping tax exemption to this trust.Taxation of Trust Income. The trustee is required to file IRS Form 1041 and Louisiana Form IT-541 to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year following the taxable year. Although tax software is widely available for this purpose, we strongly recommend having these forms prepared by an accountant because of their complexity.Distributions from the Trust. The types of distributions that can be made to the disabled beneficiary are limited to those which will not jeopardize the benefits received from any county, state, federal, or other government agency. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support (e.g., housing, food, clothing, and medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds are available). Here are some examples of permissible distributions: automobile, computer equipment, subscriptions, travel, vacations, furniture, education (tuition, books, supplies), health insurance, life insurance, sports equipment, tickets to events, medical equipment not provided by public or Medicaid funds, equipment, devices, software that assist the beneficiary with managing their disability and day to day tasks (tablet with speech software, vehicles equipped with ramps or lifts to assist entering and exiting the vehicle, etc.). Cash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:• There are no more assets in the trust.• The disabled beneficiary dies, and the assets of the trust are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or to the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.• The beneficiary has become ineligible for public benefits, per Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please read them and make sure you understand them. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about them.It is important that the trustee keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. The settlor and the trustee will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust.I hope this letter answered your immediate questions. If you would like further explanation of any aspect of administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (TX)
Go to: Formal Requirements   |   Restrictions on Trust Purposes   |   Trustees and Trust Administration   |   Related ContentMaintainedMichael Sneeringer; Anna E. Els; maintained by Pamela C. LyleThis practice note discusses the formal requirements for creating a valid trust in Texas, including intent, identifiable property, and ascertainable beneficiaries. It also covers restrictions on trust purposes, such as illegality and provisions in contravention of public policy. Finally, the note addresses the appointment and succession of trustees, as well as trustee duties, responsibilities, and liability. Settlors often create trusts to avoid a lengthy probate process and to ensure protection of assets from creditors. In order to carry out the intentions of the settlor, estate planners must understand the permissible purposes for which a trust may be established, and the attendant requirements for doing so.For a full listing of key content related to estate plans for individuals in Texas, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (TX) and Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (TX).For more information on creating a trust in Texas, see 4 Texas Probate, Estate and Trust Administration § 80.04.For a list of relevant statutes on trust creation in Texas, see 9 Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 48.02.For further discussion of trusts, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (TX) and Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (TX).Formal RequirementsTrusts created in Texas must comport with specific requirements to be valid. Under the Texas Trust Code, intent, identifiable property, and ascertainable beneficiaries all must be present in order for a trust to come into existence.IntentIt is axiomatic that a settlor cannot create an express trust without the intent to do so. Tex. Prop. Code § 112.002. See also Texas Estate Planning § 32.02[2]. Issues of intent generally boil down to one of the following:• Whether the settlor lacked capacity to enter into a trust• Whether the creation of the trust was induced by fraud, duress, or undue influence• Whether the trust was created by mistakeThe capacity required of the settlor is the same as the capacity required to make a will. See Tex. Prop. Code § 112.007. See also Texas Estate Planning § 32.02[4] and Texas Estate Planning § 20:42. If the settlor lacks capacity to convey property, then no trust arises. See also Texas Probate, Estate and Trust Administration § 45.04 ; see also Tex Jur Duress and Undue Influence § 16. Be advised, however, that there are very few cases in which trusts have been contested successfully in Texas.In Texas, a trust is enforceable only if there is written evidence of the trust's terms bearing the signature of the settlor or the settlor's authorized agent. However, if a trust consists only of personal property, it trust may be established orally or by a less formal written instrument. Tex. Prop. Code § 112.004.Identifiable PropertyAccording to common law, for a valid trust to exist, it must hold assets (i.e., there must be a trust res or property delivered to the trustee). Tex. Prop. Code § 112.005. See also 1-30 Texas Estate Planning § 30.06. Unfunded revocable trusts are increasingly common. There is some concern that a trust that is not yet valid could not be effectively named as a beneficiary under a pour-over will. However, so long as the trust instrument is validly executed and nominally funded, the trust is considered legally in existence. In re Estate of Canales, 837 S.W.2d 662 (Tex. App. 1992). In practice, the res requirement is highly unlikely to be an issue, but if a contest is anticipated, you should take steps to reduce the risk of contest by funding the trust to a degree that is more than nominal promptly after creation.Ascertainable BeneficiariesAnother old common-law rule is that to be valid a trust must have ascertainable beneficiaries. Be aware that this does not mean that a trust must have current beneficiaries. A trust is valid if there are no current beneficiaries for a period of time, and income must be accumulated for that period. However, there must be some party in a position to enforce the trust. The party enforcing the trust need not be an individual; nonnatural persons such as charities or other trusts, or in theory, other legal entities, can be beneficiaries. Additionally, animals can be the sole current beneficiaries of trusts. Tex. Prop. Code § 112.037.In contrast, there is no requirement for a trustee to be specified in a trust instrument. A trustee can always be appointed, just like a vacancy in the office of trustee can always be filled, via a court proceeding or by a mechanism provided for in the agreement.Restrictions on Trust PurposesIn general, a trust may be created for any purpose that is not illegal. Although historically, many trusts in Texas have successfully withstood trust contests, there do exist restrictions on the purpose for which a trust may be created:• Illegality. A Texas trust may be created for any purpose that is not illegal if it does not require the trustee to commit an act that is criminal, tortious, or contrary to public policy. Tex. Prop. Code § 112.031. A trust may fail if it was settled to avoid the settlor's creditors. See also Texas Estate Planning § 32.03.• Provisions contrary to public policy. While it is rare to trip over an illegality of purpose issue, it is not as uncommon to encounter provisions that are contrary to public policy. Purposes that violate public policy include those that tend to encourage criminal or tortious conduct.Trustees and Trust AdministrationThe selection of trustees and the administration of the trust are critical components of manifesting the intent of the settlor. Bifurcation of property ownership is the defining characteristic of a trust and as such, the trustee, as the individual holding title to the assets of the trust, plays an active role in its administration.TrusteesIn general, any individual, or a corporate trustee such as a bank or trust company, may serve as trustee. The selection of a trustee depends on a number of factors, including:• The settlor's preference• The time commitment that will be required of a prospective trustee• Conflicts that may exist between a potential trustee and one or more beneficiaries of the trust• The size, complexity, and potential risk of the assets of the trustAppointmentWhile the settlor may desire an independent trustee (e.g., a corporate trustee), the prospective trustee may be reluctant to serve, for example, where the trust assets consist of real estate holdings which have not been evaluated for potential risks, such as environmental hazards, and the undertaking would be cost prohibitive. More often, the size of the trust estate may not justify the fee structure of an institutional trustee. If the trust instrument nominates as trustee a bank that no longer exists, no longer accepts trust business, or refuses to administer the particular trust, and no other mechanism of filling the vacancy in the office of trustee is provided, the only solution may be to seek court appointment of a trustee. To avoid this scenario, the trust instrument should either appoint a successor trustee or provide a means for the last trustee, beneficiaries, or another third party to appoint a new trustee. See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 50C.20.Be aware that designating a trustee does not compel that person or entity to serve as such. The trustee must voluntarily qualify by formally accepting appointment, before actually commencing to serve. The initial trustees of an inter vivos trust qualify by signing the trust instrument. Successor trustees of an inter vivos trust accept by signing the instrument under which they are appointed, or signing a separate instrument drafted for that specific purpose (an acceptance of trust). In all cases, proper documentation is essential to forestall any claims that a trustee is acting without due authority. Best practices further suggest preparing documentation for the acceptance of trusteeship under testamentary trusts, including any sub-trusts that may spring into existence under the trust instrument after the death of the settlor. See also Texas Estate Planning § 120.06.SuccessionIf a trust instrument names a successor trustee, or provides for a process of naming a successor trustee, there is generally no problem with succession. However, even when a successor is not named in the trust instrument, the Court shall appoint a successor trustee upon the petition of an interested individual.. Tex. Prop. Code § 113.083.When drafting a Texas trust, it is recommended that estate planners incorporate multiple layers of trustee succession provisions. To be thorough, the practitioner may, in sequence: 1 Empower the settlor to name successors2 Authorize the settlor's spouse to designate successors3 Nominate a series of successor trustees, in order of priority listed, to serve as trustee4 Provide that the last acting trustee may appoint a further successor5 Allow a majority of the adult beneficiaries of the trust to fill any vacancy6 Identify a corporate trusteeTexas Estate Planning § 35.04; Texas Estate Planning § 170.05. While estate planners do not typically provide for all of these fallback options, some subset of them is advisable. Identification of a corporate trustee is a last resort.Carefully consider that the unrestricted power of a settlor or beneficiary to remove and replace trustees presents a trap for the unwary, as such a power may present tax complications. See Rev. Rul. 95-58, 1995-2 C.B. 191. However, the mere power to name successors should not be problematic. If the trust should not be included in the settlor's estate for estate tax purposes, the attorney will generally expressly provide in the trust instrument that the settlor cannot under any circumstances become a trustee.Trust AdministrationEffective administration of a trust requires knowledge and understanding of the trustee's fiduciary and other duties associated with administering the trust, as well as the responsibilities and liabilities inherent in the trustee's position.Duties of a Trustee – GeneralSection 113.051 of the Texas Trust Code articulates a general duty of good faith administration in accordance with the trust terms and with the Code. Unless otherwise contrary to the provisions of the Trust Code, the trustee must perform all the duties imposed by common law.Fiduciary DutyOne of the fundamental characteristics of a trust is the trustee's fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries. In its most basic translation, a fiduciary duty means that the trustee must act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. Arguably, the most famous statement on fiduciary duty in American jurisprudence comes from a New York Court of Appeals case, Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458 (1928), in which Judge Cardozo eloquently stated, "A trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior." Meinhard, 249 N.Y. at 464.The broad concept of a trustee's fiduciary duty has been broken down into various individual duties, which will be described in more detail below. It is important for counsel to understand one point that often goes overlooked in discussions about fiduciary duties: not all fiduciaries are created equal. For example, an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney is a fiduciary, but an attorney-in-fact has no affirmative obligation to act on behalf of the principal, whereas the fiduciary who has accepted the office of trustee has signed up for such a commitment. The fiduciary duties of attorneys-in-fact stem from the law of agency, not the law of trusts, and though this has not been written about extensively, less is expected of agents than of trustees. In particular, though this issue arises more often in other contexts than in estate planning, breaches of fiduciary duty in the agency context can generally be excused if they are properly disclosed, but in the trust context, disclosure alone will not suffice; informed written consent is required.Duty of LoyaltyOf the various individual duties owed by trustees, the most central to the fiduciary concept is the duty of loyalty. See Tex. Prop. Code § 117.007. See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 50C.23 .The trustee is, however, entitled to be paid reasonable compensation. Tex. Prop. Code § 114.061. See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 50C.26.A trustee is typically prohibited from engaging in self-dealing (i.e., transactions between the trustee and the trust) for the obvious reason that the trustee cannot be relied upon to seek the best result for the trust and its beneficiaries when the trustee stands on the other side of the transaction. Self-dealing falls into the general category of conflicts of interest, which a trustee is honor bound to avoid. See also Texas Probate, Estate and Trust Administration § 81.23. If, for example, a trust owns 30% of the stock in a company, and the trustee of that trust individually owns 30% of the stock, the very potential for a biased vote creates a conflict of interest. Where the trustee is permitted to vote the trust's stock, the trustee may not vote those shares in a manner that will benefit the trustee personally unless it just so happens that such vote is also in the best interests of the trust and its beneficiaries.Interestingly, the evolution of modern financial institutions has led to a softening of the prohibition on self-dealing and conflicts of interest. For example, a corporate trustee may want to invest the trust's assets in mutual funds of an affiliate of the trustee. Under traditional trust law, this would be considered prohibited self-dealing. Whether because of a recognition that it could well be in the best interests of the trust to permit such investments or lobbying from the financial services industry, such investments are now specifically authorized by statute. See Tex. Prop. Code § 113.052. However, unless the trust provides otherwise, the trustee must choose between earning commissions on such investments or its affiliate earning its standard fees; the statute does not condone double-dipping. Slay v. Burnett Tr., 143 Tex. 621, 187 S.W.2d 377 (1945). Accordingly, many corporate fiduciaries will insist on inclusion of trust language overriding the proscription against double-dipping and authorizing a range of other self-dealing transactions on the theory that the settlor is choosing the trustee at least in part because of the range of investments that will be made available to the trust. When drafting a trust that will name a corporate trustee, you should obtain from the trustee its preferred language early on in the drafting process in order to negotiate the self-dealing provisions as needed and ultimately incorporate them into the trust document. See also Texas Estate Planning § 170.05.Duty of CareThe next most basic individual duty owed by a trustee is the duty of care, or the responsibility to administer the trust with the care and skill of an ordinary prudent person. See 72 Tex. Jur. Trusts § 107; see also Texas Probate, Estate and Trust Administration § 47.01[3][d]. A trustee who is an accountant will be expected to know the tax law better than a trustee who is not a tax professional, and a corporate trustee will be expected to keep impeccable records whereas an individual trustee might be excused for minor lapses. You should be aware of two things regarding prudence. First, prudence does not mean perfection. If a trustee makes prudent investments that do not happen to work out well, the trustee has not breached its duty of care even though the trust may have lost money. Second, prudence is process-driven rather than a results-driven. If the decision-making process is sound, the trustee has fulfilled the duty of care, regardless of the result. See Tex. Prop. Code § 114.001(b).Still, it may be challenging to establish a sound process; therefore, you should encourage trustee clients to document their decision-making as thoroughly as possible. Detailed minutes of trustee meetings can save the trustee from liability. Non-trust lawyers sometimes have a bias against detailed minutes because they feel that any more detail than absolutely necessary gives potential litigants fodder for lawsuits. Whether or not that is true in other contexts, it is clearly incorrect in the trust context. You should be highly aware that the most important criterion for avoiding liability is the degree of attention to the decision-making process demonstrated by the trustee.Duty of ImpartialityAnother individual duty is that of impartiality: the trustee must treat all beneficiaries fairly. Fairly does not mean equally, though, as different beneficiaries will have different needs. The trustee must give due regard to the respective interests of the current beneficiaries and the remainder beneficiaries. For example, a current beneficiary may ask the trustee for a large distribution, justifying that the distribution is prudent (e.g., it is needed to pay for the beneficiary to go to law school and enhance her earning potential), but if the distribution constitutes a large percentage of the trust, it may unduly favor the current beneficiaries over the remaindermen. See also 72 Tex. Jur. Trusts § 64.A client may wish to favor all current beneficiaries over the remainder beneficiaries or one current beneficiaries over the other current beneficiaries. The estate planner may incorporate specific language in the trust instrument to denote such preference. For example:Without limiting the trustee's discretion, the trustee may consider the needs of the settlor's daughter as more important than the needs of other descendants of the settlor, and the settlor encourages the trustee to be liberal in making distributions to the settlor's daughter, even to the extent of distributing the entire trust principal.In a traditional trust that requires the trustee to distribute all of the trust income, the current beneficiaries may request that the trustee invest in assets that generate a great deal of income, whereas the remainder beneficiaries would rather the trustee invest in assets that have more potential for appreciation. Historically, trustees have addressed the need to balance these competing interests by investing in an even mix of bonds yielding income and stocks generating growth. However, modern portfolio theory deems this balanced approach inefficient and would instead spur the trustee to maximize or minimize expected return consistent with risk tolerance.Nevertheless, in a point that is widely misunderstood by beneficiaries and trustees alike, the results of asset allocation do not dictate the trustee's distribution decisions. In other words, if a hypothetical balanced portfolio of 50% bonds and 50% stocks generates 2% income, but the trust's actual investment portfolio produces only 1.5%, the trustee could justifiably use the power of adjustment to boost distributions to the current beneficiaries to 2%, but should not increase those distributions to 4%. Similarly, with respect to the trustee's duty of impartiality, it would be inappropriate for the trustee to invest primarily for income and distribute a windfall to the current beneficiaries.Duty to Keep Beneficiaries InformedIn theory, the duty to keep beneficiaries informed does not seem terribly complex. The trustee ought to send periodic statements to the beneficiaries so they are aware of the trust's assets and the transactions that are occurring in the trust's account. That way, the beneficiaries can fulfill their fundamental role of enforcing the proper administration of the trust. See also Texas Probate, Estate and Trust Administration § 81.21[4]. How does the attorney advise a client who does not want the children to know about the millions of dollars being held in trust for their benefit lest they lose all incentive to be productive members of society? The short answer is that, in Texas, there is not much that a trustee can do to shield this information from the beneficiaries because secrecy would constitute a breach of the trustee's fiduciary duty. Further, a beneficiary may demand an accounting of the trust and a trustee is obligated to provide an accounting within 90 days of receiving such a demand. See Tex. Prop. Code §§ 113.151 and 113.152.Other DutiesThere remain a few additional individual duties that arguably fall within those previously discussed yet warrant separate mention:• Duty to administer the trust. The trustee has the duty to administer the trust. Tex. Prop. Code § 113.051; First City Nat'l Bank v. Haynes, 614 S.W.2d 605 (Tex. App. 1981) (holding that a trustee breached its fiduciary duty by failing to pay taxes, failing to keep property in repair, and failing to clean property prior to its sale). See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 50C.23[1]. While this seems obvious, it may differ from other fiduciary duty contexts, where there may not be an affirmative duty to act.• Duty to act within scope of authority. A second duty is the obligation to act within the scope of the trustee's authority. The trustee must be authorized to take an action (e.g., if the trust does not authorize distribution to a particular beneficiary until age 21, the trustee has no authority to make earlier distributions). However, circling back to the duty of care, whether a trustee can take an action is only the first stage of the analysis. Equally important is whether the trustee should take a proposed action. For example, the trust may authorize the trustee to invest the entire trust corpus in high yield bonds or a beneficiary's start-up business, but either extreme is seldom prudent. Similarly, the trustee may have the authority to distribute all of the trust assets to the beneficiary, but if the beneficiary is financially irresponsible, full distribution is likely a poor decision.Responsibilities of a TrusteeWhen administering a trust, the terms of the trust instrument, the identity of the beneficiaries, the nature of the trust assets, the law governing the trust, the tax status of the trust, and other circumstances all influence what specific tasks the trustee must undertake. Rarely will two different trust administrations be identical.There are a few basic responsibilities that will generally apply to all trustees:• Take control of trust assets. Trustees are required to take control of the trust assets. Trustees must keep the trust assets separate and avoid commingling with their own personal assets. Eaton v. Husted, 141 Tex. 349, 172 S.W.2d 493 (1943). Fortunately, trustees may employ financial firms to hold investable assets and need not maintain certificated securities in a safe, which used to be commonplace. Tex. Prop. Code § 113.007.• Safeguard trust assets. Trustees are required to safeguard trust assets. For example, trustees should exercise prudence when choosing a custodian. Trustees should also properly insure real estate or artwork owned by the trust. • Keep accurate records. Trustees are required to maintain clear, distinct, and accurate records for the trust. You should be cognizant that it is in the trustee's best interest to be an assiduous record keeper, because a beneficiary may demand the trustee to submit an accounting of the trust administration. As part of this responsibility, the trustee may need to track income and principal separately, particularly where the trust has different standards for income and principal distributions. Tex. Prop. Code § 113.151. See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 48.23 [4].• Invest trust assets. As fiduciaries, trustees have the general authority to  invest the assets of the trust. See Tex. Prop. Code § 113.006. See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 48.23 [2]. However, trustees may delegate investment discretion to professional investment managers so long as they exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution in:o Selecting the agento Establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes and terms of the trusto Reviewing the agent's actions periodically to monitor performance and compliance with the terms of the delegationTex. Prop. Code § 117.001 et seq.• Make mandated distributions and consider distribution requests. Trustees are required to make distributions that are mandated under the trust instrument. They must also consider beneficiaries' requests for discretionary distributions when the trust instrument vests the trustee with such discretion.• File tax returns. Trustees must file any tax returns that are required for the trust. See also Texas Estate Planning § 42.06. This can be a somewhat complicated undertaking. A trust may not have a separate filing obligation under federal law if it is a grantor trust, though depending upon the circumstances, the trustee of a grantor trust may have an obligation to file an informational return. In terms of state filing obligations, like individuals, trusts may have income sourced in different states and may have to file non-resident returns in those states. Moreover, because some states classify trusts as residents based on different criteria (i.e., residence of the trustee and/or residence of the beneficiaries), a trust may be a resident of multiple states. For example, a trust established by a Texas settlor with a Delaware trustee and a California beneficiary may have to file in all three states. Additionally, if there are any international aspects to the trust, a whole additional set of reporting obligations may apply. For these reasons, attorneys should advise their trustee clients to hire accountants who have experience preparing fiduciary income tax returns, not just personal income tax returns or business entity returns.• Pursue or defend claims. Trustees may be required to pursue claims on behalf of the trust (e.g., against service providers, former trustees, or even co-trustees) or defend claims against the trust. Tex. Prop. Code § 113.019.See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 50C.22[2].Directed TrustsTexas by statute permits directed trusts, where, for example, a co-trustee (a general trustee) named in the trust instrument is vested with discretion over investments or distributions, and the role of another co-trustee (an administrative or excluded trustee) is simply to effectuate the directions it receives from the named advisors. Tex. Prop. Code § 114.0031. See also 4-84 Texas Probate, Estate and Trust Administration § 84.08[4]. So long as the excluded trustee does not participate in willful misconduct, that trustee is not responsible for a consequence resulting from compliance with the exercise of the power, and does not have a duty or an obligation to review, inquire, investigate, or make recommendations or evaluations with respect to the exercise of the power. Id.  Practitioners should be aware that Section 114.0031 of the Texas Property Code, which was amended in the 2019 Legislative session, carves out limited exceptions where trust advisors serve in a non-fiduciary capacity.  See Tex. Prop. Code § 114.0031(e).Majority DecisionsUnless otherwise specified in the trust instrument, multiple trustees who are unable to reach a unanimous decision may act by majority decision. Tex. Prop. Code § 113.085.Liability of TrusteeChapter 114 of the Texas Property Code empowers the court to remedy a breach of trust in numerous ways, including:• Compelling the trustee to perform the trustee's duties• Enjoining the trustee from committing a breach of trust• Compelling the trustee to redress a breach of trust by paying money or restoring property or by other means• Ordering a trustee to account• Appointing a special fiduciary to take possession of the trust property and administer the trust• Suspending the trustee• Removing the trustee as provided in Tex. Prop. Code § 113.082• Reducing or denying compensation to the trustee• Ordering any other appropriate reliefSee also 72 Tex Jur Trusts § 200.Generally, trustees are not personally liable for the acts of a predecessor, nor does any successor trustee have a duty to institute a proceeding or file any claim against any prior trustee, or that trustee's estate, for any of the prior trustee's actions, unless the successor trustee knew or should have known about the prior trustee's breach. Tex. Prop. Code § 114.002. See also Texas Probate, Estate and Trust Administration § 82.04[4].If the settlor is particularly concerned about reducing the trustee's liability, the trust instrument may include language exonerating a successor trustee for failing to seek redress; for example:No trustee shall be liable at any time because of, or in consequence of, any acts, omissions, or defaults with respect to the administration of the trust by any predecessor trustee, and no trustee shall have any duty to examine the accounts, records, and acts of any predecessor trustee or to institute any action or claim against any predecessor trustee to compel redress of any breach of trust or for any other reason.See also Texas Transaction Guide--Legal Forms § 50C.24[4].Trustees will generally not be held liable for actions of a co-trustee, unless the trustee does not exercise reasonable care. Tex. Prop. Code § 114.006. See also 72 Tex. Jur. Trusts § 163. A dissenting trustee who joins in an action at the direction of the majority of the trustees and who has notified any co-trustee of the dissent in writing is not liable for the action. Tex. Prop. Code § 114.006(c).Compensation of TrusteeUnless otherwise provided in the trust instrument, Trustees are entitled to reasonable compensation for administering trusts. Silence of the trust instrument with regard to compensation will not be considered a reason to deny payment, nor will a right to compensation be implied by the naming of a trustee. In general, the intent of the settlor will govern the issue of trustee remuneration.In Texas, a court will generally get involved in trustee remuneration only in the case of a dispute over the fee. Tex. Prop. Code § 114.061. The Texas Trust Code does not provide any method for establishing trustee fees. Courts, however, have allowed that a reasonableness standard will be applied.

[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][Month] [Day], [Year][name of client][address of client]RE: Funding of Revocable Living TrustDear [name of client]:Now that you have established your Revocable Living Trust (the "Trust"), you may fund it by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. An unfunded or partially funded trust does not avoid probate. While your pour over will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the Trust assets and distributed as provided in the Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the Trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as further outlined in this letter. Property is only considered trust property if it is titled in the name of the trust itself.Please review your assets to determine which to transfer into your Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Certain assets such as IRAs and some types of annuities should not be transferred to the Trust during your lifetime due to tax consequences or other considerations. Please consult my office for questions on whether an asset is appropriate or desirable for addition to your Trust property.To transfer assets to your Trust, you generally must execute new documents of title, deeds to real property, and signature cards for your bank accounts. Your financial advisor, accountant, and/or life insurance agent may need to help you make ownership or beneficiary changes. The instructions here will give you general knowledge of how to fund your Trust, but they cannot comprehensively address every type of transfer. Please call us if you must make transfers that are not addressed in these instructions, or if you would like assistance with any of these transfers. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation. Generally, you should title all of your currently owned and newly acquired assets in the name of your Trust. We prefer the following format for titling assets in the name of your Trust:[name of client], as Trustee of the [name of revocable living trust] dated [Month] [Day], [Year], and any amendments thereto.We recommend you keep copies of all written documents that evidence the ownership interest of your Trust. Additionally, it is good practice to keep a list of all assets transferred to the Trust along with the date of transfer on Schedule A of the Trust. This schedule should be updated as Trust assets are added during your lifetime.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own name (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I would be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Living Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.
Instructions for Transferring Specific Assets Cash Accounts You should sign new signature and ownership cards to retitle any sizeable bank accounts or cash equivalents, including treasury bills, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, to name yourself as Trustee of those accounts. You need not change any small joint or other checking accounts used primarily for household expenses.Before you retitle your certificates of deposit, consult with a bank officer to make sure that the institution does not consider the change in account name to be an early withdrawal that incurs a penalty. Generally, this should not be a problem because your tax identification number for the account will remain the same.Instruct your financial institution by letter or in person to change the title to your Trust. The tax identification number (your Social Security number) on the account for withholding and reporting purposes will remain the same. Sign the new signature cards as Trustee.Investment Accounts If you hold publicly traded stocks and bonds through brokerage or investment accounts, contact your brokers or custodians and direct them to change the title of the accounts to the name of your Trust. The procedure for doing so is the same as the procedure for retitling cash accounts explained above. You may have to complete new account applications and present a copy of your Certification of Trust in order to change the title. Title to the accounts should be in the Trust name.Stocks and Bonds Not Held in Investment Accounts If you possess original stock or bond certificates, new certificates may be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. Alternatively, you may open a brokerage or investment account in the name of your Revocable Living Trust and deposit your original certificates in the account. Be sure to keep track of the income tax basis of all shares as the Trustee will need that information if any shares are sold during your lifetime.Personal Effects Tangible personal property refers to such items as household furnishings, appliances and fixtures, works of art, motor vehicles, pictures, collectibles, personal wearing apparel and jewelry, books, sporting goods, and hobby paraphernalia. You can transfer your tangible personal property by executing an Assignment of Personal Property.Your personal vehicles can be titled in the name of your Revocable Living Trust, but we find that most of our clients prefer to leave their vehicles outside of the Trust. However, should you decide to title your vehicle in the name of the Trust, consult your casualty insurance agent and advise them of the change.Retirement Plans, Life Insurance Policies, and Annuities Generally speaking, ownership of these accounts should not be transferred to your Revocable Living Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the Trust. Designating the Trust as beneficiary of an annuity or retirement account may have unintended income tax consequences. Please contact me or your tax professional prior to making any such designation.Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, you may want the proceeds from the policies paid directly to your Revocable Living Trust. In order to designate the Revocable Living Trust as the beneficiary, you will need to obtain and complete change-of-beneficiary forms. Your agent should be able to assist you with naming the Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust as the beneficiary of the policy, or if not, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you. You should receive a letter confirming the change of beneficiary from the insurance company to keep with your Trust records.If you have loaned money to anyone, you should assign your interest as lender to your Revocable Living Trust by a written document and notify your debtor of the assignment. We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Partnership Interests If there are no restrictions in your partnership agreement, your interest in the partnership could be transferred through a written assignment of interest signed by you and acknowledged by your partners. It may be necessary to prepare a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement.We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.Real Property Transferring real property to your Trust will require attention to ownership and tax issues based on the nature of the current title to the property. You will need to execute new deeds for each property, which you must record with the Clerk of Court in the county where the real property is located. At your request, we will assist you with this.Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger a "due on sale" clause in the instrument. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located.You should contact your homeowner's insurance provider to discuss adding your Trust as an additional endorsee on your policy. Lastly, you may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Administering the Trust If a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Revocable Living Trust to complete the transfer, use the Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire Trust Agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually. For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock, or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.As long as you are acting as Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust, you do not need to obtain a separate tax identification number for your Trust or to file a separate Trust tax return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prefers that you use your own Social Security number. You should report all of the income generated by Trust assets on your personal IRS Form 1040.When you die, your Trust becomes irrevocable and the successor Trustee will need to obtain a tax identification number. We will work with your successor Trustee and your accountant to see that your heirs get the full benefit of your estate planning upon your death. Certain trust administration procedures will be required, and it is advisable for the successor Trustee to consult with an attorney at that time.You should review your estate plan with an attorney every two to three years because all estate plans require on-going maintenance. In particular, a change in your family circumstances, an increase in your net worth, or a change in the tax law could significantly affect your plan.I hope that this letter answers most of your immediate questions. Please call me if you have any additional questions about the transfer of property to your Trust or about the operation of the Trust in the future. This letter is for your guidance only and does not discuss all possible situations. Please keep it for future reference.
Sincerely yours,__________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Letter to Client 
Dear [name]:I am writing regarding the [name of beneficiary] Special Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year], which we have prepared for you as [settlor of the trust / trustee of the trust / both settlor and trustee of the trust].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust, and (2) address what you, as [settlor / trustee / both settlor and trustee] of the trust, need to know and think about while administering the trust. Therefore, I advise you to keep this letter for future reference.To accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the settlor and trustee must adhere to the terms of the trust agreement and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or a tax professional.The trust describes the responsibilities and the powers of the trustee(s). Since all trust documents (also called trust instruments) do not contain the same powers, the trustee must pay special attention to the language in the trust to be certain of the trustee's authority and options.This trust is a third-party special needs trust. It is designed so that the family and friends of [name of beneficiary], the beneficiary of the trust, can make gifts to benefit [name of beneficiary] while preserving the right to receive government benefits. The gifts made to the trust can take many forms: cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or even personal property. Under no circumstances should any property or assets belonging to the beneficiary be transferred into the trust. If this is done, it could jeopardize the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. Also, the beneficiary has no right to demand or withdraw any assets or property from the trust.Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust. That means it is fixed and cannot be amended or terminated, except under very limited circumstances. Also, gifts made to the trust cannot be returned. Please call me if you need to make any changes to the trust.Federal Tax Identification Number. Whether or not the trust needs its own federal tax identification number (TIN) depends on whether the trust is a grantor trust or not. A grantor trust is a trust over which the grantor or other owner retains the power to control or direct the trust's income or assets. If the trust is a grantor trust, the trustee has the choice of reporting the annual income for federal tax purposes on either IRS Form 1041 or on the income tax return of the grantor. A grantor trust does not need its own TIN. If the trust is not a grantor trust, either the trustee or the attorney for the trust must obtain a TIN for the trust by filing IRS Form SS4. The TIN will be used to identify the trust in bank accounts and tax returns.Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the trust to be in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[name of trustee], Trustee of The [name of beneficiary] Special Needs Trust dated [month] [day], [year]." (Your bank may want to use a slightly different name.) If the trust is not a grantor trust, always use the trust's TIN as the identification number for bank accounts.Your stockbroker may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the Certification of Trust or the signature page and the trustee powers will demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business.To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust.Gift Tax Return. If any gift to the trust exceeds $19,000 in value, the donor should be instructed to  complete a gift tax return (IRS Form 709) by April 15 of the following year. Please consult me concerning  allocating some or all of your generation-skipping tax exemption to this trust.Taxation of Trust Income. The trustee is required to file IRS Form 1041 [OPTIONAL: and [applicable state fiduciary income tax return]] to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year following the taxable year. Although tax software is widely available for this purpose, we strongly recommend having these forms prepared by an accountant because of their complexity.Distributions from the Trust. The types of distributions that can be made to the disabled beneficiary are limited to those which will not jeopardize the benefits received from any county, state, federal, or other government agency. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support (e.g., housing, food, clothing, and medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds are available). Here are some examples of permissible distributions: automobile, computer equipment, subscriptions, travel, furniture, education (tuition, books, supplies), health insurance, life insurance, sports equipment, tickets to events. Cash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary. Any distributions should be made directly to the third-party supplier of the goods or services.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:• There are no more assets in the trust.• The disabled beneficiary dies, and the assets of the trust are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or to the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.• The beneficiary has become ineligible for public benefits, per Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please read them and make sure you understand them. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about them.Record Keeping. It is important that the trustee keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. The settlor and the trustee will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Social Security Administration may audit trust expenditures, so it is crucial to have complete documentation.

Funding Revocable Trusts (MA)
Go to: The Importance of Funding a Revocable Living Trust   |   How to Transfer or Place Specific Assets into a Revocable Living Trust   |   Other Funding Issues   |   Future Trust AdministrationMaintainedThis practice note contains information and instructions on funding a revocable trust in Massachusetts. It provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to a revocable trust; of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. One of the primary benefits of a revocable living trust is that, if fully and properly funded during the grantor's lifetime, probate can be avoided or minimized. Therefore, it is vitally important to transfer all of a settlor's assets into the trust, ideally soon after the creation of the trust, and then on an ongoing basis as needed throughout the grantor's lifetime.Trust funding must be taken seriously and professionally, as errors can result in client complaints and malpractice claims. Some attorneys choose not to involve themselves in the funding process. Others assume responsibility for certain tasks and not for others. To the extent possible, you should determine with your client in advance who will be responsible for which tasks and clearly explain that all tasks other than those you expressly agree to undertake will be the responsibility of the client unless you subsequently agree otherwise (ideally in writing). In situations where the client is to perform some or all funding tasks, you may wish to send a follow-up/reminder letter approximately 60 days after the trust is created to reiterate the importance of funding the trust and to see if they wish to involve your help with any remaining tasks. If you choose not to take on the responsibility of funding the trust for your client, or if the client declines your offer to help, you should at least provide explicit instructions about the process to the client.This practice note offers guidance to you when funding a revocable living trust for your clients, as well as when advising your clients as to how they should fund it.For a full listing of key content related to estate plans for married or partnered people in Massachusetts, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (MA).For related practice notes, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (MA), Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (MA), and Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (MA).The Importance of Funding a Revocable Living TrustA grantor's assets must be transferred into the trust if it is to achieve one of its objectives: to simplify the transfer and administration of assets after the settlor's death. It is also necessary because the trustee only has control of the property if it is in the trust. If the grantor becomes incapacitated, the chosen successor trustee(s) will be able to continue managing trust assets without court involvement or other difficulty if the grantor's assets are in the trust at that time.To the extent that the settlor does not transfer assets into the trust, those assets will not escape probate. That is why a pour-over will should always be prepared along with the trust agreement to direct that any assets not held by the trust at the time of the grantor's death be transferred into the trust so that they will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the trust. However, a probate proceeding will be necessary to accomplish this.How to Transfer or Place Specific Assets into a Revocable Living TrustThe following items are assets that are commonly held by a grantor. You should be mindful to get a clear and accurate picture of the types of assets your client owns so you can provide appropriate advice and try to ensure everything that must be transferred to the trust actually gets transferred.Personal ResidenceIn most cases, the grantor's interest in the home should be transferred from their own name to the name of the trustee (usually, the client), as trustee. This can be achieved by a quitclaim or warranty deed, and by filing any necessary transfer tax forms. Also, as seen in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 184, § 35, the grantor must file and record a Trustee's Certificate with the transaction. For a modest fee, a title insurance company can help make sure everything is done properly and efficiently. If the client undertakes this task, you should ask to be sent a copy of the recorded deed.The following are a few special points about the transfer of a residence or any other real property into a revocable living trust:• Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 3, Massachusetts homestead residences are protected from certain creditors. It is wise to familiarize yourself and your client with these statutes. • There will be no reassessment because the transfer of real property to a revocable trust is not a "change in ownership" for property tax purposes.• There will be no transfer tax because the property has not been sold. However, appropriate transfer tax forms will need to be filed, indicating that it is a transfer for no consideration to a revocable trust.• While it is not legally required that the new deed be recorded right away, it is highly advisable to do so unless the terms of any mortgage contain language that makes it unwise. For example, most mortgage agreements have what is called an acceleration or "due on sale" clause, which means that the full balance on the mortgage becomes immediately due if there is a change in ownership. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer. Since transferring the home into the trust isn't a change of ownership of the type a due-on-sale clause is meant to address, you or the client should also contact the lender, explain what you are trying to do, and confirm that the due-on-sale clause won't be triggered. Ideally, you or the client will get this in writing from the lender.• If a client has plans to refinance a property, advise them to complete the refinance before transferring the title to the trust. Cooperative or Condominium ApartmentsIf the client has such an ownership interest, you or the client should ask the manager of the cooperative or condominium about how it should be transferred into the trust. It is likely the management will have various formalities and fees associated with the transfer, but it is nevertheless important that the transfer be made. Please also note that if the client chooses to refinance their mortgage after transferring the cooperative apartment or condominium into the trust, they may have to transfer it out of the trust in order to refinance and then transfer it back into the trust after the refinance is complete. You or the client should always consult with the lender when making these types of changes to ensure compliance with the terms of the loan agreement.Other Real PropertyA new deed is required for every other piece of real property that the client owns. As noted above, it may be necessary to obtain the permission of the lender to transfer the property into the trust. If the other real property is located in another state, you or the client should consult an attorney in that state to assist in transferring that property, as different states have different rules and customs. If your client purchases real estate in the future, the client should generally take title in trustee capacity. If the client fails to do so, the new property must go through the probate process.Savings Accounts and Certificates of DepositThese accounts should be held by the trustee as trustee of the revocable trust. Banks and similar institutions commonly see revocable trusts and are used to helping their customers with necessary changes. A copy of the trust instrument or Memorandum of Trust is usually required. Note that a Memorandum of Trust is also sometimes called a Certificate of Trust or an Affidavit of Trust. See Certificate of Trust (MA) for a sample certificate of trust. Suggest that the bank make a copy if they require it for their records. The client should keep a copy of any new card or document that they sign to effect the change. If a particular savings account cannot be transferred before a set date without losing interest, the client may decide to wait. It may be necessary to wait until a Certificate of Deposit's maturity date before it can be retitled.Checking AccountsWhile such accounts can and, in almost all cases, should be put into the name of the trust, the client may want, for a special reason, to leave one account in one's own name as an individual. However, any such account should maintain a low balance. Bank records must indicate that accounts are held in the name of the trust, but personal checks can be printed with the client's name only, without reference to the trust. Advise your client that in Massachusetts, if an estate has less than $25,000 in value, it may not be subject to a full probate. Instead, an executor/personal representative may petition for a voluntary administration, a simplified probate procedure. For more information on voluntary administration, see Purposes and Uses of a Will (MA),Governing Law of Formal Probate, Jurisdiction, and Proceedings (MA) and Governing Law of Informal Probate, Jurisdiction, and Proceedings (MA).Life Insurance PoliciesYou or the client must contact their insurance agent or the company itself to obtain their "Change of Beneficiary" and "Change of Ownership" forms. In many cases, the owner and the beneficiary should be the trust. Because these changes are not effective until they are received and acknowledged by insurance companies, you or the client should take care of this as soon as possible. Be sure to receive written confirmation from the insurance company that the desired changes have been effected in company records and by endorsement on the policy.If the client has personal reasons for naming a particular individual as beneficiary, the client certainly may do so. This means that the proceeds of the policy will be distributed directly to the named beneficiaries, and not according to the terms of the trust. There are differing opinions and considerations on whether to name individuals or the trust as the primary beneficiary of life insurance policies, and these opinions and considerations should be discussed with the client to determine the primary beneficiary of such policies. For example, if the client wants an outright distribution of insurance proceeds to a named beneficiary who is an adult, and feels that person should have access to those proceeds quickly, then naming the individual as a beneficiary instead of the trust might be advisable. Also, while creditors often can go after insurance proceeds to satisfy any debts of the deceased grantor, it is perhaps less likely that will happen if the proceeds pay out directly to a named beneficiary as opposed to them being paid out to the trust.Insurance on Property Held by the TrustInsurance contracts that provide for payments to be made if there is loss or damage to assets held in trust (e.g., title insurance and homeowner's insurance) should be amended. You or the client should ask their insurance agent to have the policy or policies amended. The trustee(s) and the trust should be named as additional insured parties, using the "name" suggested under Other Funding Issues below.The grantor, as an individual, should continue to be named as an insured party even though the trust and trustee are added as additional insured parties.Stock/SecuritiesThe transfer of stock to the trust must be accomplished by changing title on the stock certificates themselves. The client's broker can help make this change for free or for a small charge per certificate. If your client holds shares through a brokerage firm, the client will need to change the title on only the brokerage accounts, rather than on each share certificate.The stockbroker may request copies of the certification of trust and the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers should be sufficient to demonstrate that the trust is properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. Alternatively, you or the client may be able to simply provide a copy of the Memorandum of Trust.If the client holds shares in a closely held corporation, the corporation's secretary should issue new certificates in the name of the trust. The existing (old) certificates should then be canceled. Before this is done, however, it should be determined whether there is a stock restriction agreement, whether an assignment might cause some sort of forfeiture, and whether the board must approve the transfer. It would be wise to consult with corporate counsel in this regard.You or the client should send any stock certificates via registered mail, return receipt requested, with enough insurance to cover the replacement bond, in case the certificates are lost in the mail. The amount of this bond can be obtained from the brokerage, and it guards against someone else trying to transfer the certificates if they somehow fall into someone else's hands.PartnershipsPartnership interests can be complicated. To register these partnership interests in the trust's name, a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before attempting the transfer. A limited partnership agreement may indicate what is needed to transfer the interest. Such an agreement should be reviewed to determine (1) whether or not the client can transfer one's interest into the trust and, if so; (2) how to achieve this result.Promissory NotesThe client should assign each promissory note personally owned to the trust. The client can do so by typing on the back of each note the following endorsement:Pay to the order of ______________________, Trustee under ______________________ Trust Agreement Dated ______________________ ______________________.Go to table1The client should also assign the deeds of trust securing payment of the notes to the trust. You or the client need not record the assignment, but it should be prepared in the same manner as deeds to real property and should be retained in a safe place. If the trustee or a successor trustee needs to commence any action to obtain title to the property given as the security for payment of the note, the assignment can be recorded. Advise your client to notify the maker of a promissory note to make all future checks payable to the trust and not to your client.Patents and CopyrightsTo transfer patents or copyrights into a revocable trust, you or the client need to execute a written assignment of ownership document, specifically identifying the intellectual property and transferring the rights to the trust as the owner. Remember to file the necessary paperwork with the U.S. Copyright Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.IRAsIRAs must be held in the name of the individual who created the account. The client names beneficiaries on a "designation of beneficiary" form provided by the financial institution. Normally, a married person will name one's spouse as the first beneficiary and, as an alternate beneficiary, either the trust or individuals. Individuals as beneficiaries may have a few more tax elections than the trust will have. Naming the trust as beneficiary will have less such options, but would ensure that the proceeds of the account pay to beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the trust.Retirement BenefitsRetirement benefits require special consideration since both the form of benefit and the choice of beneficiary affect the client's estate plan and can have significant tax consequences. These choices also have a major impact on married persons' lives in the event one spouse enters a nursing home. The client should consult with the plan administrator about the options available now and in the future. The necessary forms may require specific wording in order for your married clients to be eligible for the marital deduction and other benefits.If your client's employment terminated before 1985, the client may be entitled to certain important tax advantages. The client should review benefits with a pension specialist prior to making any changes to the retirement benefits.Normally a married client should first designate one's spouse as beneficiary of qualified plan benefits.AutomobilesIt may not be advisable to transfer automobiles to the trust. If, however, your client has a number of automobiles, or ones of particularly high value, these should be transferred to the trust. Automobiles should not be transferred to the trust unless the client is certain that adequate liability insurance is available to cover substantial claims, as the trust may be made a party to any lawsuits following an accident involving an automobile that the trust holds as the owner. If automobiles will be transferred to the trust, your client should contact the appropriate state licensing agency for the vehicle and seek instructions on how to transfer title to the trust. Your client should also contact the insurance carrier for the vehicle to ensure the vehicle will continue to be covered once it is placed in the trust. Advise your client that under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90D, § 15A, upon the death of a married resident owner of a motor vehicle registered as a pleasure vehicle in the commonwealth, and unless otherwise provided in a will, the motor vehicle is deemed jointly held property with right of survivorship and the interest of the decedent passes to the surviving spouse.Lease AgreementsThe lease under which your client is the lessor should be assigned to the trust using an Assignment of Lease. Your client should notify the lessee in writing that all future rental checks should be made payable directly to the trust, not to your client individually. It also may be beneficial to inform tenants that the terms of their existing lease will not change, but any renewal or new lease should reflect that the landlord is the revocable trust. There is no need to show the tenants any portion of the trust agreement.Cemetery PlotsYou or the client should transfer the client's cemetery plot to the trust. This is typically done through executing an Assignment of Burial Plots & Mausoleum. The director of the cemetery should receive a copy of this assignment.FirearmsWhile a revocable trust could own firearms, it is ill-advised to transfer into or hold firearms in the trust. In addition to it imposing significant risk and liability, most firearms are highly regulated and, under federal law, some individuals are considered prohibited persons concerning firearm ownership. Firearm laws are complex, and failure to abide by them can result in fines and imprisonment. For the purposes of holding and transferring firearms, there are special purpose gun trusts. For templates related to gun trusts, see Gun Trust, Assignment of Property to Gun Trust, and Letter to Client (Funding and Administering Gun Trust).Safe-Deposit BoxMany institutions allow a revocable trust to maintain a safe-deposit box. This avoids the need to obtain a court order or institute a probate proceeding simply to open the safe-deposit box where no alternate individual is named with access to the box. Your client can transfer the safe-deposit box by assigning the rights under the existing rental agreement to the trust or by having the trust itself enter into a new rental agreement with the bank. It is also a good idea for your client to give the successor trustee authority to access the box so that if your client should become incapacitated or even deceased, the successor trustee can get into the box.U.S. Savings BondsThe federal government requires the use of Form PD 1851, Request to Reissue United States Savings Bonds to a Personal Trust, for transferring U.S. Savings Bonds. The back of the form has instructions. After you or the client have filled out the form, the client's signature must be "guaranteed" (medallion stamped) by an officer at the bank and forwarded along with the bonds to the following. For EE or I savings bonds: Treasury Retail Securities Services, PO Box 214, Minneapolis, MN 55480-0214; for HH savings bonds: Treasury Retail Securities Services, PO Box 2186, Minneapolis, MN 55480-2186.Other Personal PropertyProperty such as airplanes, yachts, horses, artwork, royalty contracts, a family business, stock options, mobile homes, partnership interests, and other rare types of property have special considerations that should be researched to determine if and how to transfer such property into the trust.Personal property items (household furniture and furnishings, books, pictures, jewelry, hobby equipment and collections, wearing apparel, and other articles of household or personal use or ornament, etc.) can be transferred by a general assignment with particular descriptions of valuable items and a provision to cover after-acquired items.Other Funding IssuesIn What "Name" Should Trust Assets Be Held?Generally speaking, assets will be retitled in substantially the following format:[Trustee name], Trustee under [trust name] Trust Agreement Dated [month day, year].It presents no problems if a bank or any other financial institution wants to hold an asset in a slightly different name. The important thing is to be sure that the trust is not confused with any other trust and that the assets are clearly held in the trust.Income Tax ReturnsAt the time the trust is established, your client should inform the client's accountant.As long as the grantor serves as the trustee (which is usually the case), the grantor will use their Social Security number as the number for the trust. Your client will file the same income tax return previously filed. If a successor trustee takes over, a tax identification number must be obtained so that the trust can file an income tax return. The trust will, in effect, file a return with the same information and pay no more taxes than your client pays now, but the information will be reported on an IRS form designed for trustees and fiduciaries.The successor trustee will use IRS Form SS-4 to obtain the new tax identification number. When the number is received, it should be communicated to the client's accountant or tax preparer, as it will be used on the tax return to be signed by the trustee.RecordkeepingNo extraordinary recordkeeping is necessary beyond that which your client would ordinarily maintain. It is important, however, that the client keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. Once changes in ownership to the trust are made, your client will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust. Information your client receives from the stockbroker or other sources of financial information should also be adequate.Preparation of Schedule AYou or your client should prepare a Schedule A listing all assets transferred to the trust. Examples of these listings are:• 100 shares, P, G & E, common• Real property at 0000 High Street, Palo Alto, California –and–• Limited partnership interest in XXX Fund 1 unitFuture Changes in Trust AssetsIf the trust should subsequently dispose of a listed asset, it may be removed from the schedule by keeping a separate schedule and indicating its disposition and the date it was disposed of. Schedule A, as originally prepared, need not be changed, as it only indicates assets as of a particular day. As assets are removed, your client should simply keep a record of the change. Likewise, if a new asset is acquired by the trust, it may be added to a new schedule.The client should review the schedule of trust assets each year when income tax returns are prepared. Delete what has been sold. Add what has been acquired and confirm that it is held in the name of the trust.Future Trust AdministrationThe focus at the time the trust is created is funding the trust and administering it during your client's lifetime. At death, certain trust administrative procedures are required, and consultation by the successor trustee with an attorney will likely be necessary. If the trust has been properly funded, the cost of trust administration will be significantly less than probate. Furthermore, if the trust contains provisions for an A/B trust, significant tax savings and other benefits are likely. You may also wish to suggest that your client create a list of their professional advisers (e.g., you, their financial planner, their CPA/tax preparer, etc.), as well as the institutions holding the grantor's assets—along with contact information for each—and keep it with their trust records. This can be of great benefit to successor trustees who may not be familiar with the grantor's assets and who to contact about those assets.Current as of: 12/12/2024

Letter to Client 
[Month Day, 20__][name of client][address of client]RE: Funding of Revocable Living TrustDear [name of client]:Now that you have established your Revocable Living Trust (the "Trust"), you may fund it by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. An unfunded or partially funded trust does not avoid probate. While your pour over will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the Trust assets and distributed as provided in the Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the Trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as further outlined in this letter.Please review your assets to determine which to transfer into your Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Certain assets should not be transferred to the Trust during your lifetime, for example, IRAs and some types of annuities.Generally, to transfer assets to your Trust, you must execute new documents of title, deeds to real property, and signature cards for your bank accounts. Your financial advisor, accountant, and/or life insurance agent may need to help you make ownership or beneficiary changes. The instructions here will give you general knowledge of how to fund your Trust, but they cannot comprehensively address every type of transfer. Please call us if you must make transfers that are not addressed in these instructions, or if you would like assistance with any of these transfers. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Generally, you should title all of your currently owned and newly acquired assets in the name of your Trust. We prefer the following format for titling assets in the name of your Trust:  [name of client], as Trustee of the [name of revocable living trust] dated [Month Day 20__], and any amendments thereto.We recommend you keep copies of all written documents which evidence the ownership interest of your Trust. Additionally, it is good practice to keep a list of all assets transferred to the Trust, along with the date of transfer, on Schedule A of the Trust.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I would be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Living Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.
Instructions for Transferring Specific Assets1. Cash Accounts. You should sign new signature and ownership cards to retitle any sizeable bank accounts or cash equivalents, including treasury bills, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, to name yourself as Trustee of those accounts. You need not change any small joint or other checking accounts used primarily for household expenses.Before you retitle your certificates of deposit, consult with a bank officer to make sure that the institution does not consider the change in account name to be an early withdrawal that incurs a penalty. Generally, this should not be a problem because your tax identification number for the account will remain the same.Instruct your financial institution by letter or in person to change the title to your Trust. The tax identification number (your Social Security number) on the account for withholding and reporting purposes will remain the same. Sign the new signature cards as Trustee.2. Investment Accounts. If you hold publicly traded stocks and bonds through brokerage or investment accounts, contact your brokers or custodians and direct them to change the title of the accounts to the name of your Trust. The procedure for doing so is the same as the procedure for retitling cash accounts explained above. You may have to complete new account applications and present a copy of your Certification of Trust in order to change the title. Title to the accounts should be in the Trust name.3. Stocks and Bonds Not Held in Investment Accounts.If you possess original stock or bond certificates, new certificates may be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. Alternatively, you may open a brokerage or investment account in the name of your Revocable Living Trust and deposit your original certificates in the account.4. Personal Effects. Tangible personal property refers to such items as household furnishings, appliances and fixtures, works of art, motor vehicles, pictures, collectibles, personal wearing apparel and jewelry, books, sporting goods, and hobby paraphernalia. You can transfer your tangible personal property by executing an Assignment of Personal Property.Your personal vehicles can be titled in the name of your Revocable Living Trust, but we find that most of our clients prefer to leave their vehicles outside of the Trust. However, should you decide to title your vehicle in the name of the Trust, consult your casualty insurance agent and advise them of the change.5. Retirement Plans, Life Insurance Policies, and Annuities.Generally speaking, ownership of these accounts should not be transferred to your Revocable Living Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the Trust. Designating the Trust as beneficiary of an annuity or retirement account may have unintended income tax consequences. Please contact me or your tax professional prior to making any such designation.Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, you may want the proceeds from the policies paid directly to your Revocable Living Trust. In order to designate the Revocable Living Trust as the beneficiary, you will need to obtain and complete change-of-beneficiary forms. Your agent should be able to assist you with naming the Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust as the beneficiary of the policy, or if not, please contact me and I will be happy to assist you. You should receive a letter confirming the change of beneficiary from the insurance company to keep with your Trust records.6. Partnership Interests. If there are no restrictions in your partnership agreement, your interest in the partnership could be transferred through a written assignment of interest signed by you and acknowledged by your partners. It may be necessary to prepare a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement.We can prepare assignment documents for each interest for your signature.7. Real Property.Transferring real property to your Trust will require attention to ownership and tax issues based on the nature of the current title to the property. You will need to execute new deeds for each property, which will need to be recorded with the Clerk of Court in the county where the real property is located. At your request, we will assist you with this.Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger a "due on sale" clause in the instrument. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located.You should contact your homeowner's insurance provider to discuss adding your Trust as an additional endorsee on your policy. Lastly, you may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Administering the TrustIf a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Revocable Living Trust to complete the transfer, use the Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire Trust Agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually. For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock, or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.As long as you are acting as Trustee of your Revocable Living Trust, you do not need to obtain a separate tax identification number for your Trust or to file a separate Trust tax return. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prefers that you use your own Social Security number. You should report all of the income generated by Trust assets on your personal IRS Form 1040.When you die, your Trust becomes irrevocable and the successor Trustee will need to obtain a tax identification number. We will work with your successor Trustee and your accountant to see that your heirs get the full benefit of your estate planning upon your death. Certain trust administration procedures will be required, and it is advisable for the successor Trustee to consult with an attorney at that time.You should review your estate plan with an attorney every two to three years because all estate plans require on-going maintenance. In particular, a change in your family circumstances, an increase in your net worth, or a change in the tax law could significantly affect your plan.I hope that this letter answers most, if not all, of your immediate questions. Please call me if you have any additional questions about the transfer of property to your Trust or about the operation of the Trust in the future. This letter is for your guidance only and does not discuss all possible situations. Please keep it for future reference.Sincerely yours,____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][date][name of client(s)][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:FUNDING YOUR REVOCABLE TRUSTNow that you have established your Revocable Trust, it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Revocable Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Revocable Trust and contact my office if you would like advice about whether to transfer specific assets into the Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the trust during your lifetime(s) include IRAs, 401ks, and some types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trusts, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually or jointly to the Revocable Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [date]One of the major goals accomplished by a Revocable Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the trust assets at the time of your deaths. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets be titled in the name of the serving Trustee—as Trustee, not in the Trustee's name individually—of the Revocable Trust and not by you individually and/or jointly, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as outlined above.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Bank Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution. The name on the bank account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trust, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Safety Deposit Box. The lessee of a safety deposit box should be changed or acquired in the name of the Trust to allow the acting Trustee access to the safety deposit box. The bank may require new signature cards.Brokerage Accounts. If you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's name and records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account on behalf of the Trust and you do not own it individually. This also applies if the certificates for those assets are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name.Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund Shares. If certificates are issued in your name(s), both individual or jointly, new certificates must be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, in order to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the Trustee during your lifetimes.Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof). These securities must also be registered in the name of the Trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed above, if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed. U.S. Savings Bonds series EE and series I are reissued electronically using Form 1851 found at treasurydirect.gov/forms/sav1851.pdf.Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or Debentures. These securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the Trustee, so that there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be accomplished by executing and delivering to the Trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust, listing the bearer securities being transferred, which will be retained by the Trustee with the permanent records of the trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. It would be helpful to keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the Trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.Tangible Personal Property including Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects). Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Revocable Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described for unregistered securities. Any new tangible investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the Trustee, as Trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the Trustee's ownership.Motor Vehicles and Mobile Homes. Motor Vehicles and Mobile Homes should be transferred to the Trust unless it has very little value, or unless you plan to dispose of it imminently. The state Department of Licensing handles the transfer of vehicle and mobile home title transfers. Be prepared to present the current title certificate(s) and Certification of Trust to effectuate the transfer.Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership). In order to register these partnership interests in the Trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest, assignment, or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted.Limited Liability Company (LLC). An LLC Operating Agreement may include provisions for disposition of membership interest upon the death of a member. A membership interest in an LLC may be transferred into the name of the Trust, if appropriate, which requires either amending the LLC Operating Agreement or an assignment of the membership interest if permitted by the LLC Operating Agreement.Real Property (Personal Residence, Investment Real Estate, and Mineral and Royalty Interests). Legal title must be transferred to the Trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a Quitclaim Deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan Benefit. Ownership of these assets generally may not be transferred to a Revocable Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the trust. Life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate unless all designated beneficiaries predecease the policyholder. You may wish to transfer ownership to your Revocable Trust to give the Trustee more control over the policies in case your designated beneficiaries predecease you or you become incapacitated.Ownership of IRAs and 401ks should not be transferred to the trust. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan Trustee to name the Trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if put into the Revocable Trust, so caution is advised.If a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Revocable Trust to complete the transfer, use the Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire trust agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually and/or jointly (even if you are the initial Trustees of the Revocable Trust). For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.Additional assets may be transferred to your Revocable Trust either by registering them in the name of the Trustee, by delivering them to the Trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the Trustee, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from your Revocable Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawal. The Trust Agreement can be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement.Federal income tax returns for a Revocable Trust are not required. If the Trustors are also the Trustee or a co-Trustee, a federal tax identification number for the trust is also not necessary, and all income is reported using the Trustors' social security numbers (which becomes the Revocable Trust's taxpayer identification number). If the Trustors are not Trustees, the Trustors' social security numbers can still be used, but the Trustee must meet certain other requirements in that case. After the Trustors' death, a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the Trust.Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your trust or about the operation of the trust in the future. This memorandum is for your general guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.

Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (NY)
Go to: Formal Requirements   |   Restrictions on Trust Purposes   |   Trustees and Trust AdministrationMaintainedby Ian Weinstock, Kostelanetz LLPThis practice note addresses requirements and restrictions on trust purposes and administration in New York. It covers formal requirements, restrictions, appointing a trustee, trustee duties, responsibilities, and liabilities.For a full listing of key content related to estate plans for married or partnered people in New York, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (NY).For related practice notes on trusts in New York, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (NY) and Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (NY).Formal RequirementsIntentIt is axiomatic that a settlor cannot create an express trust without the intent to do so. Given the requirement for trusts to be in writing (as will be discussed below), it is impossible, or nearly so, to contrive a fact pattern where a settlor is alleged to have created an express trust by implication. Issues of intent therefore generally boil down to whether the settlor lacked capacity to enter into a trust, whether the creation of the trust was induced by fraud or undue influence, or whether the trust was created by mistake. See Warren's Weed New York Real Property § 140.10.Technically, the standard for capacity to create an inter vivos trust is the slightly higher standard of contractual capacity—whether the settlor was able to understand the nature and consequences of a transaction and make a rational judgment concerning it—whereas mere testamentary capacity—knowing the nature and extent of one's assets and the natural objects of one's bounty—is all that is required to create a testamentary trust. See, e.g., In re Estate of Donaldson, 956 N.Y.S.2d 840 (Sur. Ct. 2012). (As a revocable trust is more similar to a will than to a contract, however, it may be that mere testamentary capacity would be the standard for the creation of a revocable trust.) See also Drafting New York Wills § 18.03[5]. However, the burden of proof on capacity in the inter vivos trust context is on the objectant to a trust, whereas in the context of wills and testamentary trusts, the burden of proof is on the proponent. See Id. Issues of fraud and undue influence are likely to be the same for inter vivos trusts as for testamentary trusts, and issues of mistake are likely to be the same for trusts as for contracts.Identifiable PropertyOne old common law rule is that for a valid trust to exist, it must hold assets—in old-fashioned terms, there must be a trust res delivered to the trustee. However, as discussed in Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (NY) — Reasons for Creating a Trust, unfunded revocable trusts are increasingly common. How can one reconcile these two concepts? Put simply, the unfunded revocable trust, or for that matter an unfunded irrevocable trust, is not yet a valid trust; it only becomes a valid trust upon funding. Could it be problematic to have a not-yet-valid trust? There is some concern that a trust that is not yet valid could not be effectively named as a beneficiary under a pour-over will. However, NY CLS EPTL § 3-3.7 seems clear on its face that as long as the trust agreement is validly executed, the trust can be a beneficiary under a will; no funding requirement is mentioned. See Drafting New York Wills § 18.03[8]. Nonetheless, to be safe, it has been common practice to recite in the schedule of trust assets some nominal amount of money (e.g., $10) to satisfy the requirement for a res. To satisfy the delivery requirement, a $10 bill is sometimes clipped to the schedule, though that can create problems for institutional trustees, who may be prohibited under their anti-money laundering policies and procedures from accepting cash transfers. In practice, the res requirement is highly unlikely to be an issue, but if one anticipates a contest, one can take steps to reduce the risk of the contest by funding the trust to a more-than-nominal degree promptly after creation.Ascertainable BeneficiariesAnother old common law rule is that a trust must have ascertainable beneficiaries to be a valid trust. See Drafting New York Wills § 18.10[3]. That does not mean a trust must have current beneficiaries—a trust is valid if there are no current beneficiaries for a period of time, and income must be accumulated for that period—but there must be some party in a position to enforce the trust. (Occasionally, an inartfully drafted trust will omit the designation of beneficiaries, but in such a case the drafting attorney can generally be persuaded—perhaps via the threat of a malpractice action—to claim in the context of a judicial trust reformation proceeding that the omission was a scrivener's error.) The party enforcing the trust need not be an individual; non-natural persons such as charities or other trusts, or in theory other legal entities, can be beneficiaries. And, since 1996, pets can be the sole current beneficiaries of trusts. See NY CLS EPTL § 7-8.1.In contrast, there is no requirement for a trustee to be specified in a trust instrument because a trustee can always be appointed, just like a vacancy in the office of trustee can always be filled, via a court proceeding.Acknowledged WritingOne key formal requirement of trusts under New York law is statutory as opposed to common law: NY CLS EPTL § 7-1.17 specifies that inter vivos trust agreements must be in writing and acknowledged in the same manner as is required for a recorded deed, or alternatively they must be witnessed by two witnesses. See Drafting New York Wills § 18.10[1][c]. See also Drafting New York Wills § 18.03[2]. (The witnessing alternative comes in very handy where signatories are outside the country.) Prior to the adoption of that section, oral trusts were permitted in New York, but no longer. Testamentary trusts do not have the same requirement; they are valid if the will under which they are created is valid. Of course, wills generally must satisfy all of the requirements of the statute of wills, NY CLS EPTL § 3-2.1, which include being in writing and witnessed, but there are exceptions. NY CLS EPTL § 3-2.2 permits nuncupative (i.e., oral) or holographic (i.e., handwritten and unwitnessed), but only if made by people in military service or mariners at sea. A trust created under such a will would, in theory, still be valid, though in practice nuncupative or holographic wills are likely to be short and simple, and thus highly unlikely to contain trusts.Restrictions on Trust PurposesIllegalityNY CLS EPTL § 7-1.4 codifies the common law rule that a trust may be created for any lawful purpose. See also Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 209.03. So, for example, a trust could not be used for the payment of bribes, see In re Estate of Sage, 412 N.Y.S.2d 764 (Sur. Ct. 1979). Presumably, even if the permitted uses of the trust assets were not illegal, but the actual point of creating the trust was fraudulently to conceal assets from the taxing authorities or other creditors, or otherwise to circumvent some legal requirement, the trust would be void or voidable as well. See, e.g., National Superlease Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co. of New York, 507 N.Y.S.2d 16 (App. Div. 1986) (a trust will not be recognized where the intent of the trust was to circumvent insurance law requirements).Provisions Contrary to Public PolicyIt is exceptionally rare to trip over an illegality of purpose issue. But it is not so uncommon to encounter provisions that are contrary to public policy. NY CLS EPTL § 7-3.1 refers to a specific situation that is generally contrary to public policy, namely, where a trust provides that the settlor or the settlor's spouse shall cease to be a beneficiary upon applying for government assistance. If you do Medicaid planning for clients by using trusts, that section could be implicated. But a more challenging issue is where a client asks you to include a provision in a trust disqualifying a beneficiary who marries a person of a different race or religion. There are cases in New York from the 1950s and before that permit such restrictions, but public policy is an evolving concept, and what was acceptable 60+ years ago may not be so today. You should research that issue thoroughly, including determining what courts in other states have decided more recently, before acceding to a client's request to incorporate such a provision into a trust instrument.Trustees and Trust AdministrationTrusteesAppointmentIn general, any natural person can be a trustee. The same cannot be said for non-natural persons: generally, under New York law, only a bank/trust company can be trustee. See NY CLS Bank § 131. Moreover, although national banks and New York state-chartered banks and trust companies can serve as trustee without any additional steps, an out-of-state bank or trust company must establish a trust office in New York, which subjects it to examination by New York banking regulators, or it must essentially register, on a trust-by-trust basis, with the Surrogate's Court (for testamentary trusts) or with the superintendent of banks (for inter vivos trusts). See NY CLS Bank § 131.But even for natural persons, there may be certain restrictions, at least where testamentary trusts are concerned. Specifically, under NY CLS SCPA § 707, certain categories of individuals are not eligible to receive Letters, including Letters of Trusteeship, namely:• Individuals who are not yet adults• Individuals who lack mental capacity• Felons• Individuals who are unqualified due to substance abuse, dishonesty, improvidence or want of understanding, or who are otherwise unfit• Non-U.S. citizens who are not resident in New York, unless they serve with one or more co-trustees at least one of whom is resident in New YorkSee also Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 46.01.The last of those restrictions is the one most likely to be problematic from a planning perspective, though not in connection with trusts. (Since the restriction only applies to testamentary trustees, you can plan around it by creating inter vivos trusts instead.) Rather, you may have young clients who have moved to New York from a foreign country and have no relatives here whom they would want to name as guardian of their minor children. That particular challenge is beyond the scope of this practice note, but it can be very real.There is an interesting point concerning felons. In general, a convicted felon is ineligible for Letters, but convicted felons can apply for a certificate of relief from civil disabilities under New York Corrections Law, see NY CLS Correc § 700 et seq., which, if granted, will remove the felony conviction taint under NY CLS SCPA § 707. Nonetheless, the convicted felon may be ineligible for Letters under a different part of that statute, such as if the crimes committed were crimes of dishonesty.Note that a named trustee cannot be compelled to serve as such: a named trustee must voluntarily qualify as trustee (i.e., formally accept the appointment) before actually commencing to serve. Testamentary trustees qualify by petitioning the Surrogate's Court for Letters of Trusteeship and signing the required oath and designation. The initial trustees of an inter vivos trust qualify by signing the trust agreement. Successor trustees of an inter vivos trust accept by signing the instrument under which they are appointed, or a separate instrument drafted for that specific purpose, and the trust agreement may specify the formalities with which those instruments must be executed. In all cases, proper documentation is essential to forestall any claims that a trustee is acting without due authority. That is particularly an issue for successor trustees under testamentary trusts, who may be unaware of the requirement to obtain Letters of Trusteeship. (Even corporate trustees may be unaware of the requirement if they do not do much business in New York or in the handful of other states that require Letters for testamentary trustees.)SuccessionAlthough New York has an exceptionally well-developed trust law, one area where it is not as flexible as some other jurisdictions is in trustee succession. If a trust instrument names a successor trustee, or provides for a process of naming a successor trustee, there is generally no problem. But if there is no named successor willing and able to serve, and no mechanism set forth in the trust instrument that can be used to name a successor, there is no other option besides petitioning the Surrogate's Court for the appointment of a successor, even for an inter vivos trust. See NY CLS SCPA § 1502. See also Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 46.01.In contrast, other jurisdictions may have statutes that, for example, authorize the beneficiaries to appoint a successor if the governing instrument does not provide for an effective appointment mechanism. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 736.0704.Consequently, to obviate the need to go to Surrogate's Court, when drafting a New York trust, you should incorporate multiple layers of trustee succession provisions. To be truly thorough, you could empower the grantor to name successors, and if she or he cannot, her or his spouse could have the same power, but if there is nonetheless an unfilled vacancy, named individuals A, B, and C, singly, in the order named, would be the trustee, with the last to act authorized to appoint a further successor, and in case a vacancy nonetheless arises, a majority of the adult beneficiaries could fill the vacancy, and then as a last resort, Bank X could be the trustee. Most drafting attorneys do not typically provide for that many fallback options, but some subset of them is advisable.Note that under certain circumstances, the unrestricted power of a grantor or a beneficiary to remove and replace trustees could create tax problems for that person, see Rev. Rul. 95-58, 1995-2 C.B. 191, but the mere power to name successors should not be problematic, though if your trust is not supposed to be includible in the grantor's estate for estate tax purposes, you may want to provide expressly that the grantor cannot under any circumstances become a trustee.Trust AdministrationDuties of a TrusteeFiduciary Duty GenerallyAs noted in Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (NY) — What Is a Trust?, one of the fundamental characteristics of a trust is the trustee's fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries. At its most basic, that means that a trustee must act in the best interests of the beneficiaries, requiring a certain degree of selflessness. Arguably, the most famous statement on fiduciary duty in American jurisprudence comes from a New York Court of Appeals case, Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N.Y. 458 (1928), in which Judge Cardozo eloquently stated: "A trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior." (Though many quote that case, few know that it does not involve trusts at all, so why Cardozo chose to frame the concept of fiduciary duty in terms of a trustee is not clear. Nonetheless, that statement of the law is quite powerful.) See also NY Practice Guide: Probate & Estate Admin § 26.04. The broad concept of a trustee's fiduciary duty has been broken down into various individual duties, which will be described in more detail below.But first, it is important to delve into one point that often goes overlooked in discussions about fiduciary duties: not all fiduciaries are created equal. For example, an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney is a fiduciary, but as noted in "Asset Management" in Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (NY) — Reasons for Creating a Trust, an attorney-in-fact has no affirmative obligation to act on behalf of the principal, while a trustee does. The fiduciary duties of attorneys-in-fact stem from the law of agency, not the law of trusts, and though it has not been written about extensively, less is expected of agents than of trustees. In particular, though this issue arises more often in other contexts than in estate planning, breaches of fiduciary duty in the agency context can generally be excused if they are properly disclosed, but in the trust context, disclosure alone will not suffice; informed consent is required.Duty of LoyaltyOf the various individual duties owed by trustees, the most central to the fiduciary concept is the duty of loyalty. A trust must be administered solely in the best interests of the beneficiaries, not in the interests of the trustee. (The trustee is entitled to be paid for its efforts, however.) See Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 46.06[1]. See also NY Practice Guide: Probate & Estate Admin § 26.01.A trustee cannot generally engage in self-dealing—transactions between the trustee and the trust—for the obvious reason that the trustee cannot be relied upon to seek the best result for the trust and its beneficiaries if the trustee is on the other side of the transaction. Self-dealing falls into the general category of conflicts of interest, which a trustee is honor bound to avoid as well. Say, for example, a trust owns 30% of the stock in a company and the trustee of that trust owns 30% of the stock individually. The trustee may not vote the trust's stock in a matter that will benefit the trustee personally unless the benefit accrues equally to all shareholders. The potential for a biased vote creates a conflict of interest even though no actual self-dealing is involved because there is no transaction between the trustee and the trust.Interestingly, the evolution of modern financial institutions has led to a softening of the prohibition on self-dealing and conflicts of interest. For example, a corporate trustee may want to invest the trust's assets in mutual funds of an affiliate of the trustee. Under traditional trust law, that would be considered self-dealing, and as such, prohibited. But whether because of a recognition that it could well be in the best interests of the trust to permit such investments or because of lobbying from the financial services industry, such investments are now specifically authorized by statute. See NY CLS EPTL § 11-2.3(d). See also NY Practice Guide: Probate & Estate Admin § 26.03. Note that, unless the trust provides otherwise, a trustee must choose between earning commissions on such investments or its affiliate earning its standard fees; there is no "double-dipping" permitted under the statute. However, many corporate fiduciaries will insist on inclusion of language in trusts where they serve as trustee overriding that proscription against double-dipping and also authorizing a range of other self-dealing transactions, on the theory that the settlor of the trust is choosing the trustee at least in part because of the range of investments that will thereby be made available to the trust. Therefore, when drafting a trust that will name a corporate trustee, as early in the drafting process as possible you should obtain from the trustee its preferred language on self-dealing so you can negotiate the provisions as needed and ultimately incorporate them into the trust.Duty of CareThe next most basic individual duty owed by a trustee is the duty of care, that is, the trustee must act in its administration of the trust with the care and skill of an ordinary prudent person. (A fiduciary with particular expertise in an area will generally be held to a higher standard. For example, a trustee who is an accountant will be expected to know the tax law better than one who is not, and a corporate trustee will be expected to keep impeccable records whereas an individual trustee might be excused for minor lapses in that area.) Two points are worth noting here. First, prudence does not mean perfection. If a trustee makes prudent investments that do not happen to work out well, the trustee has not breached its duty of care even though the trust may have lost money. And second, prudence is a process-driven determination rather than a results-driven determination. If the decision-making process is sound, the trustee has fulfilled its duty of care, regardless of the result. But being able to demonstrate that the process was sound can be a challenge, and you should therefore encourage your trustee clients to document their decision-making as thoroughly as possible. Detailed minutes of trustee meetings can save the trustee from liability. (As an aside, non-trust lawyers sometimes have a bias against detailed minutes because they feel that any more detail than absolutely necessary gives potential litigants fodder for lawsuits. Whether or not that is true in other contexts, it is clearly wrong-headed thinking in the trust context, where the most important criterion for avoiding liability is the degree of attention to the decision-making process that the trustee demonstrates.) See Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 46.06.Duty of ImpartialityAnother individual duty is that of impartiality: a trustee must treat all beneficiaries fairly. Note that fairly does not mean equally, as different beneficiaries may have different needs. Current beneficiaries are not the only ones whose interests need to be considered; a trustee must be fair to remainder beneficiaries as well. So, for example, a trustee may be asked by a current beneficiary for a large distribution, and can even justify why such a distribution would be prudent (e.g., it is needed to pay for the beneficiary to go to law school to enhance her earning potential), but if the distribution constitutes a large percentage of the trust, it may unduly favor the current beneficiaries over the remaindermen.That said, you may have a client who truly wants to favor the current beneficiaries over the remaindermen or one current beneficiary over others. In that case, you may want to incorporate specific language into the trust agreement:Without limiting the Trustee's discretion, the Trustee may consider the needs of the Settlor's daughter as more important than the needs of other descendants of the Settlor, and the Settlor encourages the Trustee to be liberal in making distributions to the Settlor's daughter, even to the extent of distributing the entire trust principal.In a traditional trust that requires the trustee to distribute all of the trust income, the current beneficiaries may want the trustee to invest in assets that generate a great deal of income, and the remainder beneficiaries may want the trustee to invest in assets that have more potential for appreciation. Historically, trustees addressed the need to balance these competing interests by investing in an even mix of bonds—to produce income—and stocks—to generate growth. With the primacy of modern portfolio theory in investing, however, that balanced approach to investing is deemed inefficient; instead, trustees ought to invest for the maximum total return for a given risk tolerance. In 2001, New York incorporated the concept of divorcing asset allocation decisions from distribution decisions into its trust law by authorizing trustees to adjust between income and principal, see NY CLS EPTL § 11-2.3(b)(5), or to define income as 4% of the trust assets, see NY CLS EPTL § 11-2.4. Either of these powers can be used to facilitate an optimal asset allocation under the prevailing market conditions while not running afoul of the duty of impartiality. See also Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 70.04.You should be cautioned, however, that these statutes exist for the purpose of divorcing asset allocation decisions from distribution decisions, not to give trustees a method for increasing distributions to current beneficiaries. If a hypothetical balanced portfolio of 50% bonds and 50% stocks would generate, say, 2% income, but a trust's actual investment portfolio generates 1.5%, the use of the power to adjust could justifiably be used to boost distributions to the current beneficiaries to 2%, but not to boost distributions to 4%. This point is widely misunderstood by beneficiaries and trustees alike, but you should be clear on it when advising clients: these powers can only be exercised in a manner consistent with the duty of impartiality, not so as to generate a windfall for the current beneficiaries.Duty to Keep Beneficiaries InformedIn theory, the duty to keep beneficiaries informed does not seem terribly complex. The trustee ought to send periodic statements to the beneficiaries so they are aware of the trust's assets and the transactions that are occurring in the trust's account; that way, the beneficiaries can fulfill their fundamental role of enforcing the proper administration of the trust. But what do you advise the parent who tells you that they do not want their children to know about the millions of dollars being held in trust for their benefit lest the children lose all incentive to be productive members of society? The short answer is that, in a New York-law trust, there is not much that a trustee can do to shield the beneficiaries from knowledge about the trust because to do so would be a breach of the trustee's fiduciary duty. In certain other states, such as Delaware, however, so-called silent trusts are permitted, where the trustee can be expressly relieved of any obligation to inform the beneficiaries even of the existence of the trust, and in fact can be prohibited from voluntarily releasing that information. One can question whether that is good public policy, but one can also understand the parent's concern. Perhaps, advising the parents to have frank conversations with their children about money and their expectations for being productive members of society might make sense, but advising the parent to set up the trust in Delaware would not be irrational either.Other DutiesMost other individual duties are really subsumed within one or another of the ones already discussed, but there are a few that warrant separate mention. One is the duty to administer the trust. That seems obvious, but as noted above, it is different than in other fiduciary duty contexts, where there may not be an affirmative duty to act. Another is the duty to act within the scope of the trustee's authority. For a trustee to take an action, the trustee must of course have the authority to do so (e.g., if a trust does not authorize a distribution to a particular beneficiary until age 21, the trustee has no authority to make distributions to that beneficiary any earlier). But, circling back to the duty of care, whether a trustee can take an action is only the first stage of the analysis; equally important is whether the trustee should take that action. The trustee may be authorized to invest the entire corpus of the trust in high yield bonds, or in a beneficiary's start-up business, but that does not mean doing so would be prudent. Similarly, the trustee may have the authority to distribute all of the trust assets to the beneficiary, but if the beneficiary is financially irresponsible, that may be a poor decision. See Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 46.05.Responsibilities of a TrusteeIt is a rather obvious point that, in administering a trust, the terms of the trust instrument, the identity of the beneficiaries, the nature of the trust assets, the law governing the trust, the tax status of the trust and the other circumstances applicable to the trust all influence what specific tasks the trustee must undertake, and rarely will those tasks be identical for two different trusts. Nonetheless, there are a few basic responsibilities that trustees will generally have:• Trustees are required to maintain custody of the trust assets. Fortunately, though, as discussed in "Asset Management" in Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (NY) — Reasons for Creating a Trust, trustees are permitted to employ financial firms to hold investable assets, and do not need to maintain certificated securities in a safe, which used to be commonplace. Note that trustees are not permitted to commingle their own assets with those of the trust. See NY CLS EPTL § 11-1.6.• Trustees are required to safeguard trust assets, which may mean choosing a custodian prudently and it may mean properly insuring real estate or artwork owned by the trust.• Trustees are required to maintain records for the trust. And it is in the trustee's best interest to do just that, and to do so assiduously, because when a beneficiary calls on the trustee to submit an accounting of its administration of the trust, if the trustee lacks sufficient information to properly and fully account, the beneficiaries and the Surrogate's Court may well draw negative inferences that the trustee cannot rebut. Note that separately tracking income and principal may be required, particularly where the trust has different standards for income and principal distributions. There are detailed rules in EPTL Article 11A on allocation of receipts and disbursement to income or principal, which can affect not only distributions but also the computation of trustee commissions. See Compensation of Trustee below.• Trustees are required to invest the assets of the trust, though as noted in "Asset Management" in Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (NY) — Reasons for Creating a Trust, trustees can delegate investment discretion to professional investment managers as long as they choose them prudently and oversee them prudently.• Trustees are required to make whatever distributions are required under the trust instrument and are required to consider beneficiaries' requests for discretionary distributions if the trust instrument vests the trustee with any distribution discretion.• Trustees are required to file whatever tax returns are required for the trust. That can be a somewhat complicated undertaking. A trust may not have a separate filing obligation under Federal law because it is a grantor trust, though depending on circumstances there may be an informational return filing obligation even for a grantor trust. And in terms of state filing obligations, like individuals, trusts may have income sourced in different states and may have to file non-resident returns in those states. Moreover, because different states classify trusts as resident in the state based on different criteria, a trust may be resident in more than one state. For example, a trust established by a New York settlor with a Delaware trustee and a California beneficiary may have to file in all three states. Finally, as discussed in Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (NY) — Tax Considerations, there are certain New York idiosyncrasies that may need to be considered as well. And if there are any international aspects to the trust, a whole additional set of reporting obligations may apply. You therefore ought to advise your trustee clients to hire accountants with experience preparing fiduciary income tax returns, not just personal income tax returns or business entity returns.• Finally, trustees may be required to pursue claims on behalf of the trust, against service providers that have acted improperly, or against former trustees or even co-trustees who have done the same.See also Drafting New York Wills § 18.03[7].Certain states, such as Delaware and South Dakota, by statute permit so-called "directed trusts," where, for example, an investment advisor or a distribution advisor named in the trust agreement is vested with discretion over investments or distributions, as the case may be, and the trustee's role is simply to effectuate the directions it receives from the named advisors. In those states, the trustee is not responsible for making any decisions within the spheres of activity for which it is directed, and it is generally protected from liability if it acts as directed even if the direction is imprudent. New York law does not yet countenance directed trusts, and though you could draft a New York trust to operate like a directed trust, the trustee of such a trust would have no statutory protection from liability merely because it acted as directed. Consequently, you presumably ought to advise clients who want directed trusts to set them up in states whose laws expressly provide for them.Note that, unless otherwise specified in the trust instrument, multiple trustees are to act by majority. See NY CLS EPTL § 10-10.7.Liability of TrusteeNew York generally follows the common law rules when it comes to trustee liability. A trustee who breaches their fiduciary duty can be surcharged (i.e., held liable for damages), can have their commissions denied, or both, and in extreme cases, a trustee can even be removed. Claims against a trustee are typically brought in the context of an accounting proceeding. See NY CLS SCPA § 2205.A run-of-the-mill violation of the duty of care—say, neglecting to file tax returns in a jurisdiction where there was a filing obligation—would generally expose the trustee to surcharge, and the damages are designed to put the trust in the position it would have been in had the violation not occurred. But a denial of commissions would presumably only be appropriate where the violation was of a nature and severity that could reasonably be deemed a violation of the duty to administer the trust. See In re Estate of Kramer, 356 N.Y.S.2d 984 (Sur. Ct. 1977) (referring to executors but presumably no less applicable to trustees). This treatment is logical, because commissions are compensation for the administration of the trust, and even if the trustee makes some mistakes in that administration, the trustee is still working to administer the trust and has earned that compensation. But if the trustee is "asleep at the switch," so to speak, to such an extent that the trust is not actually being administered, then the trustee has not earned their commissions. And a serious violation of the duty of loyalty, referred to traditionally as a breach or violation of trust—if, for example, the trustee steals from the trust, or uses the trust's assets to enrich himself or herself at the trust's expense—or a violation of law is generally grounds for removal. See NY CLS SCPA § 711, NY CLS SCPA § 719, and NY CLS EPTL § 7-2.6. See also NY Practice Guide: Probate & Estate Admin § 26.04. See also Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 33.10.Any provision in a will that purports to exonerate a trustee for violation of the duty of care is void as contrary to public policy. See NY CLS EPTL § 11-1.7. No such limitation applies to inter vivos trusts, and it is not uncommon to see liability in inter vivos trusts limited to acts of gross negligence. Abrogation of all of a trustee's fiduciary duties, however, even in an inter vivos trust, is void as contrary to public policy.Trustees are generally not liable for the acts of a predecessor, but may be liable for failing to seek redress against a predecessor trustee. See NY CLS SCPA § 1506 (in the related context of a trustee receiving property from an executor). See also Warren's Heaton on Surrogate's Court Practice § 46.06. If the settlor of a trust is particularly concerned about the potential liability of successor trustees, language exonerating a successor trustee for failing to seek redress can be added to an inter vivos trust:No Trustee shall be liable at any time by reason of, or in consequence of, any acts, omissions or defaults with respect to the administration of the trust by any predecessor trustee, and no Trustee shall have any duty to examine the accounts, records and acts of any predecessor trustee or to institute any action or claim against any predecessor trustee to compel redress of any breach of trust or for any other reason.In contrast, trustees will generally be held liable for actions of a co-trustee, even if they do not participate in those actions, if they knew or should have known of them, unless they dissent in writing. See NY CLS EPTL § 10-10.7. Even dissenting in writing will not, however, absolve a trustee of liability for failure to prevent a true breach of trust or a failure to administer the trust.Compensation of TrusteeTrustees are entitled to commissions for administering trusts. Under NY CLS SCPA § 2309, individual trustees are entitled to annual commissions based on the value of the principal of the trust according to a graduated rate schedule:• 1.05% on the first $400,000 of principal• 0.45% on the next $600,000 of principal• 0.30% on the balance of the principalIn addition, individual trustees are entitled to so-called "paying-out" commissions of 1% of principal distributed. Note that paying-out commissions would apply whenever principal leaves a trustee's control, which would apply not only to distributions to beneficiaries, but also disbursements that are allocable to principal, and also turning over the trust assets to a successor trustee, so changing trustees can be expensive! And if a trustee is directed or authorized to retain income but not add it to principal, the trustee is entitled to commissions for subsequently paying out that retained income of 2% on the first $2,500 and 1% on the balance. However, most trusts authorize adding any undistributed income to principal, and since doing so simplifies record-keeping, it is common practice; commissions on paying out accumulated income are therefore rarely seen.Principal paying-out commissions are payable from principal and income paying-out commissions are payable from income, whereas annual commissions are payable one-third from income and two-thirds from principal. Commissions payable from income must be paid from that year's income, so if a trustee mistakenly distributes all of the income for a given year without reserving for the portion of the trustee's commissions payable from income, that portion will be forfeited. (If income is retained, however, that result would not apply.) Trustees can pay themselves commissions only after furnishing to the beneficiaries a statement showing the trust's assets, the trust's transactions for the year, and the computation of the commissions.Multiple trustees are entitled to split two commissions, regardless of how many trustees there are, unless the trust instrument provides otherwise. See NY CLS SCPA § 2313.Corporate trustees are generally entitled under NY CLS SCPA § 2312 to "reasonable compensation" except to the extent the trustee has agreed to take a different amount pursuant to the trust instrument or a separate agreement. What constitutes reasonable compensation is undefined, though it is at least equal to the commission of an individual trustee. In any event, it is standard practice for corporate trustees to charge commissions at their published rate schedule unless there is an agreement to the contrary. The same rules about allocation of commissions to income and principal and the same requirement for furnishing a statement to the beneficiaries before taking commissions apply to corporate trustees just as well as individual trustees.Current as of: 12/19/2024End of Document

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][date][name of client(s)][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:FUNDING YOUR REVOCABLE TRUSTNow that you have established your Revocable Trust, it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Revocable Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation. Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Revocable Trust and contact my office if you would like advice about whether to transfer specific assets into the Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the trust during your lifetime(s) include IRAs, 401ks, and some types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trusts, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually or jointly to the Revocable Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [date]One of the major goals accomplished by a Revocable Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the trust assets at the time of your deaths. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets subject to probate be titled in the name of the serving Trustee—as Trustee, not in the Trustee's name individually—of the Revocable Trust and not by you individually and/or jointly, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets subject to probate in the name of your Revocable Trust as outlined above.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Bank Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution. The name on the bank account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trust, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Safety Deposit Box. The lessee of a safety deposit box should be changed or acquired in the name of the Trust to allow the acting Trustee access to the safety deposit box. The bank may require new signature cards.Brokerage Accounts. If you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's name and records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account on behalf of the Trust and you do not own it individually. This also applies if the certificates for those assets are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name.Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund Shares. If certificates are issued in your name(s), both individual or jointly, new certificates must be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, in order to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the Trustee during your lifetimes.Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof). These securities must also be registered in the name of the Trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed above, if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed. U.S. Savings Bonds series EE and series I are reissued electronically using Form 1851 found at treasurydirect.gov/forms/sav1851.pdf.Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or Debentures. These securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the Trustee, so that there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be accomplished by executing and delivering to the Trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust, listing the bearer securities being transferred, which will be retained by the Trustee with the permanent records of the trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. It would be helpful to keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the Trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.Tangible Personal Property including Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects). Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Revocable Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described for unregistered securities. Any new tangible investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the Trustee, as Trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the Trustee's ownership.Motor Vehicles and Mobile Homes. Motor vehicles and mobile homes should be transferred to the Trust unless they have very little value, or unless you plan to dispose of them imminently. The state Department of Licensing handles the transfer of vehicle and mobile home title transfers. Be prepared to present the current title certificate(s) and Certification of Trust to effectuate the transfer.Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership). In order to register these partnership interests in the Trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest, assignment, or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted. Limited Liability Company (LLC). An LLC Operating Agreement may include provisions for disposition of membership interest upon the death of a member. A membership interest in an LLC may be transferred into the name of the Trust, if appropriate, which requires either amending the LLC Operating Agreement or an assignment of the membership interest if permitted by the LLC Operating Agreement. Real Property (Personal Residence, Investment Real Estate, and Mineral and Royalty Interests). Legal title must be transferred to the Trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a Quitclaim Deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan Benefit. Ownership of these assets generally may not be transferred to a Revocable Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the trust. Life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate unless all designated beneficiaries predecease the policyholder. You may wish to transfer ownership to your Revocable Trust to give the Trustee more control over the policies in case your designated beneficiaries predecease you or you become incapacitated. Ownership of IRAs and 401ks should not be transferred to the trust. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan Trustee to name the Trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if put into the Revocable Trust, so caution is advised.If a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Revocable Trust to complete the transfer, use the Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire trust agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually and/or jointly (even if you are the initial Trustees of the Revocable Trust). For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.Additional assets may be transferred to your Revocable Trust either by registering them in the name of the Trustee, by delivering them to the Trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the Trustee, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from your Revocable Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawal. The Trust Agreement can be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement.Federal income tax returns for a Revocable Trust are not required. If the Trustors are also the Trustee or a Co-Trustee, a federal tax identification number for the trust is also not necessary, and all income is reported using the Trustors' social security numbers (which becomes the Revocable Trust's taxpayer identification number). If the Trustors are not Trustees, the Trustors' social security numbers can still be used, but the Trustee must meet certain other requirements in that case. After the Trustors' death, a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the Trust.Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your trust or about the operation of the trust in the future. This memorandum is for your general guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.

Letter to Client 
Table of Contents
Dear [name of client]:I am writing with regard to the [name of beneficiary] Supplemental Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year], which we have prepared for you, as [settlor of the trust/trustee of the trust/both settlor and trustee of the trust].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust; and (2) discuss what you, as [settlor/settlor and trustee] of the trust need to know and think about in the future. Therefore, I advise you to keep this letter for future reference. In order to accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the settlor and trustee must adhere to the terms set forth in the trust document and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or the person who prepares your tax returns.The trust describes the responsibilities and the powers of the trustee(s). Since all trust documents (also called trust instruments) do not contain the same powers, the trustee must pay special attention to the language in the trust to be certain of the trustee's authority and options. This trust is a Third-Party Supplemental Needs Trust. It is designed so that the family and friends of [name of beneficiary], the beneficiary of the trust, can make gifts to benefit [him/her] while preserving [his/her] right to receive government benefits. The gifts made to the trust can take many forms: cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or even personal property. Under no circumstances should any property or assets belonging to the beneficiary be transferred into the trust. If this is done, it could jeopardize the beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. Also, the beneficiary has no right to demand or withdraw any assets or property from the trust.1. Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust. That means it is fixed and cannot be amended, except under very limited circumstances. Also, gifts made to the trust cannot be returned. Please call me if you need to make any changes to the trust.2. Federal Tax Identification Number. Whether or not the trust needs its own Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN) depends on whether the trust is a grantor trust or not. A grantor trust is a trust over which the grantor or other owner retains the power to control or direct the trust's income or assets. If the trust is a grantor trust, the trustee has the choice of reporting the annual income for federal tax purposes on either IRS Form 1041 or on the income tax return of the grantor. A grantor trust does not need its own tax identification number. If the trust is not a grantor trust, either the trustee or the attorney for the trust must obtain a federal tax identification number for the trust by filing IRS Form SS4. The trust will then need to file IRS Form 1041 to report income. The tax identification number will be used to identify the trust in bank accounts and tax returns. 3. Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee in order for the trust to be in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[Name of Trustee], Trustee of The [Name of Beneficiary] Supplemental Needs Trust dated [month] [day] [year]." (Your bank may want to use a slightly different name.) Likewise, the same title should be used for beneficiary designations of any assets naming the trust as beneficiary. However, individuals should use caution when considering naming the trust as beneficiary of an ERISA-governed retirement plan or IRA as the stretch tax rules for inherited retirement accounts could affect the trust beneficiary's eligibility for government benefits. If the trust is not a grantor trust, always use the trust's TIN as the identification number for bank accounts.Your stockbroker may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by his or her firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers will demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. A certification of trust prepared in accordance with North Carolina law may also sometimes be used in lieu of the entire trust agreement.To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust unless transferred upon death. 4. Gift Tax Return. If any gift to the Trust exceeds $18,000.00 in value for 2024 (amount adjusted annually), the donor should be instructed to complete a gift tax return (IRS Form 709) by April 15 of the following year. Please consult me concerning allocating some or all of your generation-skipping tax exemption to this trust.5. Taxation of Trust Income. The trustee is required to file IRS Form 1041 and North Carolina Form D-407 to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year following the taxable year. Although tax software is widely available for this purpose, we strongly recommend having these forms prepared by an accountant because of their complexity. 6. Distributions from the Trust. The types of distributions that can be made to the disabled beneficiary are limited to those which will not jeopardize the benefits he or she receives from any county, state, federal, or other government agency. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support (for example, housing, food, clothing, and medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds is available). Here are some examples of permissible distributions: automobile, computer equipment, subscriptions, travel, furniture, education (tuition, books, supplies), health insurance, life insurance, sports equipment, and tickets to events. Cash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary, even if they are reimbursements or prepayments for acceptable expenditures. Instead, payments should be made directly to third parties. Distributions also should not be made to or for the benefit of anyone other than the beneficiary. If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me. 7. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:(a) There are no more assets in the trust.(b) The disabled beneficiary dies and the assets of the trust are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.(c) The beneficiary has become ineligible for public benefits, per Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.8. Trustee Powers. A detailed list of the trustee's powers can be found in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust. Please read them and make sure you understand them. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about them.9. Record Keeping. It is important that the trustee keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. The settlor and the trustee will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust.
I hope that this letter has answered all of your immediate questions. If you would like further explanation of any aspect of administering the trust, please do not hesitate to contact me.Sincerely____________________[name of attorney]End of Document

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][date][name of client(s)][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:Now that you have established your Revocable Trust, it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Revocable Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Revocable Trust and contact my office if you would like advice about whether to transfer specific assets into the Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the trust during your lifetime(s) include IRAs, 401ks, and some types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trusts, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually or jointly to the Revocable Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [date]One of the major goals accomplished by a Revocable Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the trust assets at the time of your deaths. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets be titled in the name of the serving Trustee—as Trustee, not in the Trustee's name individually—of the Revocable Trust and not by you individually and/or jointly, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as outlined above.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Bank Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution. The name on the bank account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trust, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Safety Deposit Box. The lessee of a safety deposit box should be changed or acquired in the name of the Trust to allow the acting Trustee access to the safety deposit box.

If you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's name and records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account on behalf of the Trust and you do not own it individually.

Correira; John FendtThis practice note is intended to provide guidance on drafting an express trust and administering a trust in Massachusetts. It covers formal requirements of a trust, drafting considerations, permissible trust purposes, trustee selection and appointment, and duties and powers of trustees.For a full listing of key content on creating an estate plan for an individual with a spouse or partner residing in Massachusetts, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (MA).For more information on different types of trusts and the purposes of a trust, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (MA). For more information on revoking, amending, or termination a trust, see Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (MA).Formal RequirementsMethods of Creating an Express TrustThere are three ways an express trust can be created:• Transfer property to another person as trustee during the settlor's lifetime or by will or other disposition taking effect on the settlor's death• Declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds identifiable property as trustee• Exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trusteeMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 401.Requirements for Creating a TrustGeneral Requirements for Trust CreationThe general requirements for creation of a trust are set forth in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 402(a), as follows:• The settlor must have capacity to create a trust. In the case of a pour-over will with a simultaneous revocable inter vivos trust, the standard for mental capacity is the same for the trust as it is for the will. Maimonides Sch. v. Coles, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 240, 881 N.E.2d 778 (2008) (a pour-over will and a contemporaneously executed revocable inter vivos trust comprise integrally related components of a single testamentary scheme).• The settlor must indicate an intention to create the trust.• The trust must have a definite beneficiary, unless the trust is:o A charitable trusto A trust for the care of an animal (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 408) –or–o A trust for a noncharitable purpose (see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 409).• The trustee must have duties to perform.• The same person cannot be the sole trustee and the sole beneficiary.A definite beneficiary is one who can be ascertained now or in the future, subject to any applicable rule against perpetuities. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 402(b). A power in a trustee to select a beneficiary from an indefinite class is valid. But if the power is not exercised within a reasonable time, the power fails and the property subject to the power passes to the persons who would have taken the property had the power not been conferred. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 402(c).A trust is void to the extent its creation was induced by fraud, duress, or undue influence. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 406.Oral Trusts over Personal PropertyMassachusetts recognizes express oral trusts over personal property, but not real estate. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203, § 1 (trust over real property must be created by written instrument). The beneficiaries must receive notice of the creation of the trust. However, notice is not necessary when other acts or declarations of the settlor are sufficient and complete in themselves or if the personal property is delivered to the trustee. Welch v. Henshaw, 170 Mass. 409, 414, 49 N.E. 659 (1898). The creation of an oral trust and its terms must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 407.No particular words are necessary to create an oral trust, but a "mere declaration of trust by a voluntary settlor, not communicated to the donee and assented to by him, is not sufficient to perfect a trust." Boynton v. Gale, 194 Mass. 320, 323, 80 N.E. 448 (1907).Other factors considered in determining the existence of an enforceable oral trust include the definitiveness and certainty with which both the property to be entrusted and the beneficiaries are described, whether the trustee's discretion is so broad as to allow him or her to bestow no benefits on the supposed beneficiaries, and whether the beneficiaries have a natural claim to the property of the person who created the trust. See Cooney v. Montana, 347 Mass. 29, 35, 196 N.E. 2d 202 (1964).Of course, although oral trusts may in some instances be legally recognized, the better practice is to set forth the terms of the trust in writing.Written Trusts for Real PropertyTrusts concerning land must be created or declared by a written instrument signed by the party creating or declaring the trust or by his or her attorney. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203, § 1. For trusts over real estate, the recording of the instrument, or of a conforming certificate, in the registry of deeds or the registration office of the land court, is equivalent to actual notice of the existence of the trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203, § 2.Beneficiary versus Qualified BeneficiaryA beneficiary is ''a person who has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent.'' Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 103. A qualified beneficiary, however, is a beneficiary who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined:• A distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal• Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that dateMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, §§ 103, 110.The distinction is relevant because qualified beneficiaries are a subset of beneficiaries. A qualified beneficiary has the right to demand and receive information about the trust and a beneficiary only has the right to receive benefits not information. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 813.Testamentary and Contemporaneous Inter Vivos TrustIf a trust is coupled with a will, then the same formalities will apply. For example, in Maimonides Sch. v. Coles, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 240, 881 N.E.2d 778 (2008), the court held that a pour-over will and a contemporaneously executed revocable inter vivos trust comprise integrally related components of a single testamentary scheme. An important feature of that scheme is its disposition of property not during a testator's lifetime in the manner of a more traditional inter vivos trust, but after death in the manner of a will. The use of one standard for mental capacity to execute a pour-over will and another standard to execute a simultaneous revocable inter vivos trust would unnecessarily and impractically risk inconsistent results. For further discussion of testamentary formalities, see Requisites, Instrumentation, and Will Provisions (MA).Drafting ConsiderationsPlanning for ContingenciesA well drafted trust instrument should provide for contingencies—both expected and unexpected. Some common contingencies covered in trusts instruments are discussed below.SurvivorshipA beneficiary may potentially predecease the settlor or may die prior to the date of distribution of the trust benefits to that beneficiary. If that occurs, and there are no contingent beneficiaries set forth in the trust instrument, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-707 provides:(a) If an instrument is silent on the requirement of survivorship, a future interest under the terms of a trust shall be contingent on the beneficiary surviving the distribution date. In that case, if a beneficiary of a future interest under the terms of a trust fails to survive the distribution date, the following shall apply:(1) If the future interest is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift shall be created in the beneficiary's surviving descendants. Such descendants shall take per capita at each generation the property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled had the beneficiary survived the distribution date.(2) If the future interest is in the form of a class gift, other than a future interest to issue, descendants, heirs of the body, heirs, next of kin, relatives, or family, or a class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift shall be created in the deceased beneficiary or beneficiaries' surviving descendants. The property to which the beneficiaries would have been entitled had all the beneficiaries survived the distribution date shall pass to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiaries. Each surviving beneficiary shall take the share to which the surviving beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiaries survived the distribution date. Each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take per capita at each generation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiary survived the distribution date. For the purposes of this paragraph, "deceased beneficiary" shall mean a class member who failed to survive the distribution date and left one or more surviving descendants.(b) If, after the application of subsection (a), there is no surviving taker, the property shall pass in the following order: (1) If the trust was created in a nonresiduary devise in the transferor's will or in a codicil to the transferor's will, the property shall pass under the residuary clause in the transferor's will. For purposes of this section, a residuary clause shall be treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust.(2) If no taker is produced by the application of clause (1), the property shall pass to the transferor's heirs under [Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 190B,] Section 2-711.Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-707(a), (b).Counsel should determine whether these default survivorship provisions are in accordance with the settlor's wishes and, if not, draft an appropriate alternative survivorship provision.New Class MembersAnother contingency to consider when drafting class gifts in a trust is the possibility of new members of a class being born or adopted into the class. Thus, unless the settlor wishes to restrict the beneficiaries to specific named individuals, the better drafting practice is to refer to classes of people defined in relation to each other and avoid naming specific individuals as beneficiaries. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-708.DivorceThe possibility of divorce is another contingency to consider. An individual who is divorced from the decedent is not considered a surviving spouse for purposes of a will or trust unless, by a subsequent marriage, the individual is married to the decedent at the time of death. A judgment of separation that does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not considered a divorce for this purpose. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-802(a). In addition, unless the governing instrument provides otherwise, any revocable disposition of property made to the former spouse is revoked by a subsequent divorce, as is any nomination of the former spouse as a fiduciary under the instrument. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-804(b)(1). Counsel should confer with the client regarding what alternative arrangements the client would like to make in the event of divorce and include appropriate provisions in the trust document.Extent of DiscretionA trust instrument may potentially give a trustee little or no discretion or considerable discretion over a variety of matters relating to administration of the trust, such as the amount or timing of distribution of income or principal to beneficiaries, the types of investments that the trustee may invest the trust assets in, and other matters. With respect to distributions in particular, the trustee's exercise of discretion may have tax implications, which counsel should review with the client. The degree of discretion given to the trustee in the trust instrument should be tailored appropriately to achieve the client's objectives, both with respect to tax impacts and nontax considerations.Power to DecantDecanting is one way to help the trustee have some flexibility to deal with unanticipated future developments. The term decanting ordinarily is used to describe the distribution of irrevocable trust property to another trust pursuant to the trustee's discretionary authority to make distributions to, or for the benefit of, one or more beneficiaries of the original trust. Ferri v. Powell-Ferri, 476 Mass. 651, 655, 72 N.E.3d 541 (2017). Trustees may wish to decant to achieve a variety of favorable tax or nontax results or to address changes in state law or in other circumstances affecting management or administration of the trust after the trust has become irrevocable. In some states, decanting is regulated by statute, but Massachusetts has no specific decanting statute. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has, however, acknowledged that the trustee's power to decant can in some instances be inferred from broadly worded discretion to distribute trust income and assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. See, e.g., Ferri v. Powell-Ferri, 476 Mass. 651, 655–58, 72 N.E.3d 541 (2017); Morse v. Kraft, 466 Mass. 92, 98–99, 992 N.E.2d 1021 (2013). However, rather than relying on an implied power to decant being inferred by the courts, counsel should discuss with the client whether or not to provide the trustee with the express power to decant trust assets.Permissible Trust PurposesLawful Purpose RequiredA trust may be created only to the extent its purposes are lawful and not contrary to public policy. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 404.Purpose TrustA purpose trust is a trust which is established for a purpose rather than for specified beneficiaries. There are three types of permissible purpose trusts under Massachusetts law:• Charitable trusts. A charitable trust may be created for the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, the promotion of health, governmental or municipal purposes, or other purposes which are beneficial to the community. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 405(a).• Pet trusts. A trust for the care of an animal may be created under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 408.• Noncharitable purpose trust. A settlor may create a trust for any legal noncharitable purpose under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 409. For further discussion of Purpose Trusts, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (MA) under this subtopic.Trustees and Trust AdministrationTrusteesSelecting a TrusteeThe choice of a trustee or trustees is a critical decision. Even when a trust has very restrictive provisions, the trustee still has a great deal of discretion and responsibility. See Mass Gen. Laws ch. 203E, §§ 815, 816.A trustee must administer the trust as a prudent person would considering the purposes, terms, and other circumstances of the trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 804. A trustee must be someone who both understands the duties of a trustee and can carry out those duties. Thus, it is important to select a person or entity who can capably administer the trust and manage its assets. If there is no friend or family member capable of and interested in administering the trust, a professional trustee may be required, although doing so may entail additional cost.A trustee should have the confidence of the beneficiaries, and be fair minded, organized, and able to maintain records. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, §§ 803, 810.Ideally, the trustee should also be someone who does not have a financial interest in the trust, to avoid potential conflicts of interest. As noted previously, the same person cannot be both the sole trustee and the sole beneficiary. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 402(a).The location of the trustee may also be a factor to consider. A trustee is required to take reasonable steps to take control of and protect the trust property. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 809. If the trust assets include real estate, a trustee who is local to the property will be able to check on the property and may be more familiar with local laws.Finally, a trustee may have to make unpopular decisions. Unhappy beneficiaries may question the trustee's judgment. The trustee must be someone who will be able to handle the potential litigation and legal liability resulting from his or her decisions and management of the trust.AppointmentThe trust instrument should name a specific person or persons (or entity) to be trustee. However, no one can be compelled to act as a trustee. A person who has been designated as a trustee must accept or deny the trusteeship. Acceptance is achieved by substantially complying with a method of acceptance provided in the terms of the trust or, if the terms of the trust do not provide a method or the method provided in the terms is not expressly made exclusive, by accepting delivery of the trust property, exercising powers or performing duties as trustee, or otherwise indicating acceptance of the trusteeship. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 701(a).If a designated trustee does not accept the trusteeship within a reasonable time after knowing of the designation, he or she will be deemed to have rejected the trusteeship. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 701(b).SuccessionThe trust instrument should not only name a trustee, but it should also name a successor trustee or provide a process for naming one. See Mass Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 704. Naming a successor trustee is important because the original trustee(s) can unexpectedly become incapacitated or die. Furthermore, in some instances, the expected trust duration may be longer than the trustee's life span. For example, for a trust such as a dynasty trust, which is intended to last for multiple generations, the choice of trustees and the trustee succession provisions are particularly important to consider.If one or more co-trustees remain in office, a vacancy in a trusteeship need not be filled. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 704(b). If there are no remaining trustees to fill a vacancy in a trusteeship, then the vacancy will be filled in the following order of priority:• A person designated by the terms of the trust to act as successor trustee• A person appointed by unanimous agreement of the qualified beneficiaries• A person appointed by the courtMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 704(c).Trust AdministrationDuties and Powers GenerallyThe trustee must administer the trust in good faith. Mass Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 801. The trustee has many duties in administering the trust, including a duty of loyalty and a duty of impartiality. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, §§ 802–803. The trustee also has a duty to administer the estate as a prudent investor would, exercising exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 804.The trust instrument may and should set for the scope of the trustee's duties and powers. In the absence of such provisions, though, the trustee has the duties and powers set forth in the MUTC.Fiduciary Duty GenerallyOne of the unique characteristics of a trust is the bifurcation of ownership. The trustee has legal title to the property, but the beneficiaries have an equitable interest in the property. On acceptance of a trusteeship, the trustee must administer the trust in good faith, in accordance with its terms and purposes and the interests of the beneficiaries, and in accordance with the provisions of the Massachusetts Uniform Trust Code (MUTC). Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 801; see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 802(a) (trustee must administer trust solely in interests of beneficiaries). Furthermore, under the Massachusetts Prudent Investor Act, a trustee must invest and manage the trust assets solely in the interest of the beneficiaries. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 6.For more information about the characteristics of a trust, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (MA).Duty of LoyaltyOne of the trustee's most important duties is to administer the trust solely in the interests of the beneficiaries. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 802(a). While the trustee is entitled to reasonable compensation for his or her services in administering the trust, the trustee cannot act in his or her own interests. For example, a sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving trust property entered into by the trustee for his or her own personal account or affected by a conflict between the trustee's fiduciary and personal interests is voidable except in certain circumstances. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 802(b)–(c). Even a transaction involving non-trust property may involve a conflict between the trustee's personal and fiduciary interests if the transaction involves an opportunity properly belonging to the trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 802(d). However, it is not considered self-dealing if a trustee makes an investment in securities of an investment company to which the trustee, or its affiliates, provide services in a capacity other than a trustee, as long as the investment complies with the prudent investor rule. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 802(e).ImpartialityA trustee must act impartially or fairly to all beneficiaries. If a trust has two or more beneficiaries, the trustee must act impartially in investing, managing, and distributing the trust property, giving due regard to the beneficiaries' respective interests. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 803.Fairly does not mean equally because different beneficiaries will have different needs. In investing, protecting, and distributing the trust estate, a trustee must act impartially and with due regard for the diverse beneficial interests created by the terms of the trust. Middlesex Sav. Bank v. Cooper, 26 Mass. L. Rep. 243, 2009 Mass. Super. LEXIS 277 (Mass. Super. Ct. Worcester Sept. 21, 2009). The duty of impartiality applies to successor trustees as well. Harrison v. Marcus, 396 Mass. 424, 486 N.E.2d 710 (1985).Prudent Administration and InvestmentThe prudent trustee rule exists in Massachusetts through common law and through the enactment of the Massachusetts Uniform Trust Code and the Massachusetts Prudent Investor Act. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 801 et seq. (MUTC); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 1 et seq. (Prudent Investor Act); see also Chase v. Pevear, 383 Mass. 350, 362, 419 N.E.2d 1358 (1981) (common law investing with prudence). A trustee must administer the trust as a prudent person would, considering the purposes, terms, and other circumstances of the trust. In doing so, the trustee must exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 804. In addition, in administering a trust, the trustee may incur only costs that are appropriate and reasonable in relation to the trust property, the purposes of the trust, and the skills of the trustee. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 805.A trustee who invests and manages trust assets owes a duty to the beneficiaries of a trust to comply with the prudent investor rule. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 2(a). However, the prudent investor rule may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the provisions of a trust. In addition, a trustee is not liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reasonable reliance on the provisions of the trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 2(b).The prudent investor standard requires a trustee to invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would, considering the purposes, terms, and other circumstances of the trust. In satisfying this standard, the trustee must exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 3(a). The trustee's investment and management decisions regarding individual assets will be considered in the context of the trust portfolio as a part of an overall investment strategy reasonably suited to the trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 3(b).Among circumstances that a trustee must consider in investing and managing trust assets are the following, to the extent relevant to the trust or its beneficiaries:• General economic conditions• Possible effect of inflation or deflation• Expected tax consequences of investment decisions or strategies• Role that each investment or course of action plays within the overall trust portfolio• Expected total return from income and the appreciation of capital• Other resources of the beneficiaries• Needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or appreciation of capital• Asset's special relationship or special value, if any, to the purposes of the trust or to one of the beneficiariesMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 3(c).A trustee may invest in any kind of property or type of investment consistent with the standards set forth in the Prudent Investor Act. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 3(e). A trustee must reasonably diversify the investments of the trust unless, under the circumstances, it is prudent not to do so. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 4.A trustee must make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the investment and management of trust assets. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 3(d). A trustee who has special skills or expertise, or is named trustee in reliance on the trustee's representation that the trustee has such special skills or expertise, has a duty to use such special skills or expertise. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 3(f); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 806.A trustee is permitted to consult with accountants and financial advisers. After obtaining advice or consultation, the trustee may take the information or suggestions into account, but then must exercise independent, prudent, and impartial fiduciary judgment on the matters involved. The Woodward School for Girls, Inc. v. City of Quincy, 469 Mass. 151, 13 N.E.3d 579 (2014). However, as noted below, a trustee is also permitted to delegate investment and management functions if it is prudent to do so. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 10.Compliance with the prudent investor rule is determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of a trustee's decision or action. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 9.Duty to Keep Beneficiaries InformedThe trustee has a duty to keep the qualified beneficiaries of the trust reasonably informed about the administration of the trust. In addition, a trustee should promptly respond to a qualified beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust, unless the request is unreasonable under the circumstances. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 813(a).The trustee must inform the qualified beneficiaries, in writing, of his or her name and address within 30 days after acceptance of the trust or the trust becomes irrevocable, whichever is later. The information should be delivered or sent by ordinary first-class mail. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 813(b).The trustee has the duty to send at least an annual account of trust income and principal to the distributees and other qualified beneficiaries who request it. A report should also be sent at the termination of the trust. While the account can be formal or informal, it should include information relating to the trust property liabilities, receipts, and disbursements, including the amount of the trustee's compensation. In addition, the account should include a listing of the trust assets, and the market value of those assets, if feasible. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 813(c).A beneficiary may waive the right to a trustee's account of trust income or principal or other information otherwise required to be furnished under § 813. This waiver can be withdrawn. A waiver does not relieve the trustee from accountability and potential liability for matters that the account or other information would have disclosed. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 813(d).Note that some states allow for a silent or quiet trust. Some settlors do not want beneficiaries to get accountings because they do not want the beneficiary to know about the amount of money they are to receive in trust because that knowledge might dampen the beneficiary's work ethic. However, Massachusetts does not currently allow for such a trust.Duty to Furnish BondIn the case of a testamentary trust, a trustee must furnish a bond for the performance of the trustee's fiduciary duties and a surety. However, this requirement can be waived by the terms of the trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 702. For inter vivos trusts, there is no bond requirement unless the terms of the trust require one.Other Responsibilities of TrusteeWhile the needs of every trust are different, there are a few basic statutory responsibilities that generally apply to all trustees.Control and Protection of Trust PropertyA trustee must take reasonable steps to take control of and protect the trust property. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 809.Recordkeeping and Identification of Trust PropertyA trustee must keep adequate records of the administration of the trust. A trustee must keep trust property separate from the trustee's own property. A trustee may, however, invest the property of two or more separate trusts as a whole, if the trustee maintains records clearly indicating the respective interests of each trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 810.Enforcement and Defense of ClaimsA trustee must take reasonable steps to enforce claims of the trust and to defend claims against the trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 811.Collecting Trust PropertyA trustee must take reasonable steps to compel a former trustee or other person to deliver trust property to the trustee and to redress a breach of trust known to the trustee to have been committed by a former trustee. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 812.Exercise of Discretionary PowersA trustee must exercise a discretionary power in good faith and in accordance with the terms and purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 814(a).Distributions to BeneficiariesThe trustee must of course distribute income and/or principal to the trust beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the trust. In the absence of a spendthrift provision, those distributions may be subject to attachment by creditors. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 501.To the extent that the trust confers on the trustee a power to make discretionary distributions, the following rules apply unless the trust terms expressly provide otherwise:• A person other than a settlor who is a beneficiary and trustee of a trust that confers on the trustee a power to make discretionary distributions to or for the trustee's personal benefit may exercise the power only in accordance with an ascertainable standard.• A trustee may not exercise a power to make discretionary distributions to satisfy a legal obligation of support that the trustee personally owes another person.Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 814(b).The rules set forth in § 814(b) do not apply, however, to:• A power held by the settlor's spouse who is the trustee of a trust for which a marital deduction was previously allowed –or–• Any trust during any period that the trust may be revoked or amended by its settlorMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 814(d). In addition, a power that is limited or prohibited by § 814(b) may be exercised by a majority of the remaining trustees whose exercise of the power is not so limited or prohibited. If the power of all trustees is so limited or prohibited, the court may appoint a special fiduciary with authority to exercise the power. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 814(c).On the occurrence of an event terminating or partially terminating a trust, the trustee must proceed expeditiously to distribute the trust property to the persons entitled to it, subject to the right of the trustee to retain a reasonable reserve for the payment of debts, expenses, and taxes. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 817(b). Prior to distributing the trust property on termination of the trust, the trustee may send to the beneficiaries a proposal for distribution. The right of any beneficiary to object to the proposed distribution shall terminate if the beneficiary does not notify the trustee of an objection within 30 days after the proposal was sent, but only if the proposal (1) informed the beneficiary of the right to object and of the time allowed for objection, and (2) provided the beneficiary with sufficient material facts to enable the beneficiary to evaluate the proposal. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 817(a).Powers of TrusteeGenerally, the powers of the trustee are specified by the terms of the trust and may be exercised by the trustee without court authorization. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 815(a)(1). In addition, except as limited by the terms of the trust, the trustee may, without court authorization, exercise:• All powers over the trust property that an unmarried competent owner has over individually owned property• Any other powers appropriate to achieve the proper investment, management, and distribution of the trust property –and–• Any other powers conferred by the MUTCMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 815(a)(2).In addition to the general powers set forth above and those set forth in the trust, the MUTC lists a number of specific powers that trustees may exercise, subject to any limits set forth in the trust. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 816.The trustee's exercise of any power is subject to the fiduciary duties prescribed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 801 et seq., as discussed above. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 815(b).Delegation of FunctionsUnder the Prudent Investor Act, a trustee may delegate investment and management functions to an agent if it is prudent to do so. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 10(a). In doing so, the trustee must exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution in:• Selecting an agent• Establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes and terms of the trust –and–• Periodically reviewing the agent's actions in order to monitor the agent's performance and compliance with the terms of the delegationMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 10(a).A trustee who complies with the above requirements is not liable to the beneficiaries or to the trust for the decisions or actions of the agent to whom the function was delegated. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 10(c).In performing a delegated function, an agent owes a duty to the trust to exercise reasonable care to comply with the terms of the delegation. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 10(b). By accepting the delegation of trust functions from the trustee of a trust that is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, an agent submits to the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts courts. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203C, § 10(d).Liability of TrusteeLiability to BeneficiaryA violation by a trustee of a duty the trustee owes to a beneficiary is a breach of trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1001(a). To remedy a breach of trust that has occurred or may occur, the court may:• Compel the trustee to perform the trustee's duties• Enjoin the trustee from committing a breach of trust• Compel the trustee to redress a breach of trust by paying money, restoring property, or other means• Order a trustee to account• Appoint a special fiduciary to take possession of the trust property and administer the trust• Suspend the trustee• Remove the trustee• Reduce or deny compensation to the trustee• Subject to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1012 (protection of third parties dealing with trustee), void an act of the trustee, impose a lien or a constructive trust on trust property, or trace trust property wrongfully disposed of and recover the property or its proceeds• Order any other appropriate reliefMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1001(b).There are several situations where the trustee will not be held liable. First, a trustee who acts in reasonable reliance on the terms of the trust as expressed in the trust instrument is not liable to a beneficiary for a breach of trust to the extent the breach resulted from the reliance. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1006.Second, a trustee will not be held liable for a breach of trust if the beneficiary while having capacity, in writing, consented to the conduct constituting the breach, released the trustee from liability for the breach, or ratified the transaction constituting the breach. However, a release, consent, or ratification will not relieve the trustee of liability if (1) it was obtained by improper conduct by the trustee; or (2) at the time of the release, consent, or ratification, the beneficiary did not know of the material facts relating to the breach of trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1009.In addition, if the happening of an event or change of status, including, but not limited to, birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, performance of educational requirements, or death, affects the administration or distribution of a trust, a trustee who has exercised reasonable care to ascertain the happening of the event or change of status is not liable for a loss resulting from the trustee's lack of knowledge. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1007.A term of a trust relieving a trustee of liability for breach of trust is unenforceable to the extent that it:• Relieves the trustee of liability for breach of trust committed in bad faith or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the beneficiaries –or–• Was inserted as the result of an abuse by the trustee of a fiduciary or confidential relationship to the settlorMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1008(a).In addition, an exculpatory term drafted or caused to be drafted by the trustee may be invalid as an abuse of a fiduciary or confidential relationship unless the trustee proves that its existence and contents were adequately communicated to the settlor. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1008(b).Note that once a beneficiary has received a final account or other statement fully disclosing the matter and showing termination of the trust relationship between the trustee and the beneficiary, any claim against a trustee for breach of trust will be barred unless the claim was commenced within six months after receipt of the final account or statement. Furthermore, a claim for breach of trust will be barred, notwithstanding the lack of full disclosure, if the beneficiary fails to commence the claim within three years after the beneficiary was informed by the trustee of the location and availability of the final records for examination. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1005(a). In addition, for claims not barred by § 1005(a), a beneficiary may not commence a proceeding against a trustee for breach of trust more than three years after the date the beneficiary or a representative of the beneficiary knew or reasonably should have known of the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1005(b). Finally, if § 1005(a) and (b) do not apply, a judicial proceeding against a trustee for breach of trust must be commenced within five years after the first of the following to occur:• The removal, resignation, or death of the trustee• The termination of the beneficiary's interest in the trust• The termination of the trustMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1005(c).Liability to Third PartiesExcept as otherwise provided in the contract, a trustee is not personally liable on a contract properly entered into in the trustee's fiduciary capacity in the course of administering the trust if the trustee, in the contract, disclosed the fiduciary capacity. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1010(a).A trustee is personally liable for torts committed in the course of administering a trust or for obligations arising from ownership or control of trust property, including liability for violation of environmental law, only if the trustee is personally at fault. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1010(b).A claim based on a contract entered into by a trustee in the trustee's fiduciary capacity, on an obligation arising from ownership or control of trust property, or on a tort committed in the course of administering a trust, may be asserted in a judicial proceeding against the trustee in the trustee's fiduciary capacity, whether or not the trustee is personally liable for the claim. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1010(c).Liability of a trustee who is a general partner in a partnership owned by the trust is governed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1011.Compensation of TrusteeThe terms of the trust should specify the trustee's compensation. However, the court may allow more or less compensation than that provided in the trust instrument if:• The duties of the trustee are substantially different from those contemplated when the trust was created.• The compensation specified by the terms of the trust would be unreasonably low or high.Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 708(b).If the terms of the trust do not specify the trustee's compensation, a trustee is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 708(a).In addition to compensation, the trustee is also entitled to be reimbursed out of the trust property, with interest as appropriate, for expenses that were:• Properly incurred in the administration of the trust –or–• Not properly incurred in the administration of the trust, to the extent necessary to prevent unjust enrichment of the trustMass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 709(a).Note that an advance by the trustee of money for the protection of the trust creates a lien against trust property to secure reimbursement with reasonable interest. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 709(b).Resignation or Removal of TrusteeAt any point in the existence of a trust, a trustee may resign. However, in the case of a revocable trust, the trustee must give 30 days' notice to the settlor and all co-trustees. In the case of any other trust, the trustee must give 30 days' notice to the qualified beneficiaries and all co-trustees of the trust. The trustee can also ask the court for approval. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 705(a). In approving a resignation, the court may issue orders and impose conditions reasonably necessary for the protection of the trust property. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 705(b). Any liability of a resigning trustee or of any sureties on the trustee's bond for acts or omissions of the trustee are not discharged or affected by the trustee's resignation. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 705(c).The trustee can also be removed. The settlor, a co-trustee, or a beneficiary may request the court to remove a trustee, or a trustee may be removed by the court on its own initiative. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 706(a). The court may remove a trustee if:• The trustee committed a serious breach of trust.• A lack of cooperation among co-trustees substantially impairs the administration of the trust.• The trustee is unfit or unwilling, or persistently fails, to administer the trust effectively, and the court determines that removal of the trustee best serves the interests of the beneficiaries.• There has been a substantial change of circumstances or removal is requested by all of the qualified beneficiaries, the court finds that removal of the trustee best serves the interests of all of the beneficiaries and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust, and a suitable co-trustee or successor trustee is available.Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 706(b).Pending a final decision on a request to remove a trustee, or in lieu of or in addition to removing a trustee, the court may order such appropriate relief under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 1001(b) (discussed above under Liability of Trustee) as may be necessary to protect the trust property or the interests of the beneficiaries. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 706(c).A trustee who has resigned or been removed must expeditiously deliver any trust property within his or her possession to the co-trustee, successor trustee, or other person entitled to it. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 707.Rules of ConstructionIn interpreting a trust, the intent of the settlor is paramount. See Hillman v. Hillman, 433 Mass. 590, 593, 744 N.E.2d 1078 (2001); Walker v. Walker, 433 Mass. 581, 587, 744 N.E.2d 60 (2001). In determining the settlor's intention with respect to the trustee's powers, the courts regard as particularly significant the language used by the donor viewed in light of the rule of law in effect at the time the powers in question were created. Morse v. Kraft, 466 Mass. 92, 98, 992 N.E.2d 1021 (2013). The Massachusetts courts ''tend to disfavor'' interpretations that would resolve ambiguities by attributing to the settlor ''an intention which as a practical matter is likely to benefit the taxing authorities and no one else." Morse v. Kraft, 466 Mass. 92, 98, 992 N.E.2d 1021 (2013), citing Hillman v. Hillman, 433 Mass. 590, 593, 744 N.E.2d 1078 (2001).Under MUTC, the rules of construction that apply to wills also apply to the interpretation of revocable trusts and the disposition of trust property. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 112; see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-601 et seq. (rules of construction applicable to wills); see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-701 et seq. (rules of construction applicable to wills and donative dispositions in other governing instruments). For purposes of § 112, a revocable trust means a trust that is (1) revocable by the settlor until the time of the settlor's death; (2) created or amended by the settlor after the effective date of the MUTC chapter; and (3) intended to dispose of the settlor's property at death, whether under will or otherwise and whether or not the trust was funded at the time of the settlor's death. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 203E, § 112.To avoid the possibility of courts applying default rules of interpretation that may differ from the client's actual intent, counsel should carefully draft the trust language to reflect the client's intent as clearly as possible.Time Limitations on Trust DurationThe rule against perpetuities was developed to prevent transferors from limiting the transferability of property beyond a specified period and thus avoiding dynastic property and trusts. In the context of trusts, the rule is implicated when the trust terms create future interests that may not vest within 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. The rule originated in the common law, but Massachusetts has adopted a statutory rule against perpetuities. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 190B, § 2-901.Related ContentResource Kits• Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (MA)Current as of: 07/01/2025End of Document

Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (IL)
Go to: Formal Requirements   |   Trustees and Trust Administration   |   Related ContentMaintainedby William Dyrcz, The Law Offices of William Dyrcz (updated by Amina Saeed, River Valley Law Firm)This practice note discusses formal trust requirements and restrictions for an Illinois client and also includes topics such as appointment of trustees and successor trustees; and trust administration, including trustee duties, liabilities, and compensation, in Illinois. For the purposes of this practice note, a trust is an estate planning tool that can be used to accomplish basic and sophisticated wealth preservation and succession planning.Effective January 1, 2020, the Illinois Trust and Trustee's Act 760 ILCS 5/1 et seq. is repealed. A new Illinois Trust Code, 760 ILCS 3/101 et seq. (the Code) is added to the statutes. While the Act applies to trusts created after January 1, 2020, there are some retroactive provisions. 760 ILCS 3/813.2(b), (c).For a full listing of key content on creating an estate plan for an individual with a spouse or partner residing in Illinois, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (IL).For more background information on trusts, including characteristics of a trust and the reasons an individual might want to create one, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (IL). For information on trust terminations and modifications, see Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (IL).Formal RequirementsIntentIt is axiomatic that a settlor cannot create an express trust without the intent to do so. Given the general requirement for trusts to be in writing (see exception discussed below), it is impossible, or nearly so, to contrive of a fact pattern where a settlor is alleged to have created an express trust by implication. When construing a trust, Illinois courts apply the same rules that apply to the construction of wills. See Harris Trust and Savings Bank v. Donovan, 145 Ill. 2d 166, 163 Ill. Dec. 854, 582 N.E. 2d 120, 123 (1991).Identifiable PropertyAn analogy to having a well drafted but unfunded trust would be similar to purchasing a new luxury car. Until the owner puts gas in, it will only sit in the driveway. An old common law rule is that for a valid trust to exist, it must hold assets (i.e., there must be a trust res or property delivered to the trustee). However, unfunded revocable trusts are increasingly common. How are these two concepts reconciled? Put simply, the unfunded revocable trust, or for that matter an unfunded irrevocable trust, is not yet a valid trust; it only becomes a valid trust upon funding. Could it be problematic to have a not-yet-valid trust? There is some concern that a trust that is not yet valid could not be effectively named as a beneficiary under a pour-over will. To be safe, it has been common practice to recite in the schedule of trust assets some nominal amount of money (e.g., $10) to satisfy the requirement for a res. In practice, the res requirement is highly unlikely to be an issue, but if a contest is anticipated, steps may be taken to reduce the risk of contest by funding the trust to a more-than-nominal degree promptly after creation.Ascertainable BeneficiariesThe Code defines beneficiaries as having a "present or future beneficial interest… vested or contingent, assuming nonexercise of powers of appointment." 760 ILC 3/103(A)(3). The term also includes nontrustees who have a power of appointment over trust property. 760 ILCS 3/103(3)(B). The Code defines a current beneficiary as a recipient or potential recipient of trust income or principal and also includes charities, as well as those with a power of appointment over trust property. 760 ILCS 3/103(9). The Code also defines "qualified beneficiaries" as current beneficiaries, excluding charities, those with a power of appointment, and all presumptive remainder beneficiaries. 760 ILCS 3/103(30).Methods of Creating a TrustA trust may be created by:• Transfer of property to another person as trustee during the settlor's lifetime or by will or other disposition taking effect upon the settlor's death• Declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds identifiable property as trustee –or–• Exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trustee760 ILCS 3/401Creation RequirementsA trust is created only if:• The settlor has capacity to create a trust• The settlor indicates an intention to create the trust• The trust has a definite beneficiary or is: (a) a charitable trust; (b) a trust for the care of an animal as provided in Section 408 of the Code, or a trust as provided in Section 409 of the Code• The trustee has duties to perform –and–• The same person is not the sole trustee and sole beneficiary760 ILCS 3/402A trust need not be in writing; however, to prove that an oral trust exists, it must be established by clear and convincing evidence. 760 ILCS 3/407.Trustees and Trust AdministrationTrusteesAppointmentIn general, any individual, or a corporate trustee such as a bank or trust company, may serve as trustee. The selection of a trustee depends on a number of factors, including the settlor's preference; the time commitment that will be required of a prospective trustee; conflicts that may exist between a potential trustee and one or more beneficiaries of the trust; and the size, complexity, and potential risk of the assets of the trust.While the settlor may desire an independent trustee (e.g., a corporate trustee), the prospective trustee may be reluctant to serve, for example, where the trust assets consist of real estate holdings which have not been evaluated for potential risks (e.g., environmental hazards) and such an undertaking would be cost prohibitive. More often, the size of the trust estate may not justify the fee structure of an institutional trustee. If the trust instrument nominates as trustee a bank that no longer exists, no longer accepts trust business, or refuses to administer the particular trust, and no other mechanism of filling the vacancy in the office of trustee is provided, the only solution may be to seek court appointment of a trustee. To avoid this scenario, the trust instrument should either appoint a successor trustee or provide a means for the last trustee, beneficiaries, or another third party to appoint a new trustee.Notably, designating a trustee does not compel that person or entity to serve as such. The trustee must voluntarily qualify (i.e., formally accept appointment) before actually commencing to serve. The initial trustees of an inter vivos trust qualify by signing the trust instrument. Successor trustees of an inter vivos trust accept by signing the instrument under which they are appointed, or they sign a separate instrument drafted for that specific purpose (i.e., an acceptance of trust). In all cases, proper documentation is essential to forestall any claims that a trustee is acting without due authority. Best practices further suggest preparing documentation for the acceptance of trusteeship under testamentary trusts, including any sub-trusts that may spring into existence under the trust instrument after the death of the settlor.SuccessionIf a trust instrument names a successor trustee, or provides for a process of naming a successor trustee, there is generally no problem. However, even where a successor is not named in the trust instrument, Illinois law contains a flexible mechanism for the appointment of successor trustees to permit the beneficiaries to avoid court proceedings in many cases where a successor trustee is necessary. For the order and procedure for successor trustees, see 760 ILCS 3/704. Regardless, when drafting an Illinois trust, it is recommended that estate planners incorporate multiple layers of trustee succession provisions. To be thorough, the practitioner may empower the grantor to name successors; next authorize the grantor's spouse to designate successors; then nominate a series of successor trustees, in order of priority listed, to serve as trustee; provide that the last acting trustee may appoint a further successor; allow a majority of the adult beneficiaries of the trust to fill any vacancy; and finally, as a last resort, identify a corporate trustee. While estate planners do not typically provide for all of these fallback options, some subset of them is advisable. One cannot force a person to serve as an agent so a provision for resignation by a trustee is important as well. See 760 ILCS 3/705 for the resignation of a trustee.Trust AdministrationPowers and Duties of a TrusteeIllinois leaves open the powers that a trustee has in administering a trust. The statute does specifically list various duties of the trustee. A person establishing a trust may specify in the instrument the rights, powers, duties, limitations, and immunities applicable to the trustee, beneficiary, and others and those provisions where not otherwise contrary to law shall control, notwithstanding the rights, powers, duties, limitations, and immunities provided in the statute. Even when a duty is imposed by statute on a trustee, the settlor may expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise alter the duty by express provisions of the trust instrument, and the trustee is not liable to a beneficiary for the trustee's reasonable and good faith reliance on those express provisions. 760 ILCS 3/1006.  A trustee shall give bond to secure performance of the trustee's duties only if the court finds that a bond is needed to protect the interests of the beneficiaries or is required by the terms of the trust and the court has not dispensed with the requirement. See 760 ILCS  3/702(a). The court may specify the amount of a bond, its liabilities, and whether sureties are necessary. Also, the court may modify or terminate a bond at any time. A corporate fiduciary is qualified to do trust business, need not give bond, even if required by the terms of the trust. 205 ILCS 620/1-5.05.Illinois does go into great detail regarding investment management, delegation of investment decisions, and specific statutory powers that a trustee may exercise unless prohibited by the settlor's directives.Prudent Investor RuleA trustee administering a trust has a duty to invest and manage the trust assets as follows:The trustee has a duty to invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would considering the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust. This standard requires the exercise of reasonable care, skill, and caution and is to be applied to investments not in isolation, but in the context of the trust portfolio as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy that should incorporate risk and return objectives reasonably suitable to the trust.760 ILCS 3/901 et seq.While the statute above states what a trustee must do, a settlor may not wish to name a bank or trust company to handle the management and distributions of trust assets either due to the impersonal nature of a trust company, the cost financial institutions charge for trust services, or because they prefer to have a family member handle the family's financial matters. An individual that a settlor wishes to name as a trustee may not feel comfortable picking stocks, bonds, and other investments for family beneficiaries and may wish to seek advice in managing other people's wealth and still serve as trustee for the family. Illinois provides a statutory method for an individual trustee to obtain financial advice and continue on as the trustee free from personal liability to the beneficiaries.Duty Not to DelegateA trustee has a duty not to delegate to others the performance of any acts involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, except acts constituting investment functions that a prudent investor of comparable skills might delegate under the circumstances. The trustee may delegate those investment functions to an investment agent. See 760 ILCS 3/807(a)-(b). In order for the trustee to delegate the investment functions:• The trustee must exercise reasonable care and skill.• The trustee must conduct an inquiry into the experience, performance history, professional licensing or registration, if any, and financial stability of the investment agent.• The investment agent shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state of Illinois.• The investment agent shall be subject to the same standards that are applicable to the trustee.• The investment agent shall be liable to the beneficiaries of the trust and to the designated trustee to the same extent as if the investment agent were a designated trustee in relation to the exercise or nonexercise of the investment function.• The trustee shall send written notice of its intention to begin delegating investment functions to the beneficiaries eligible to receive income from the trust on the date of initial delegation at least 30 days before the delegation.If all these requirements are satisfied, the trustee shall not be responsible for the investment decisions of the investment agent. See 760 ILCS 3/808(f).Trustee PowersIllinois law grants the trust creator (settlor, grantor, trustor, trustmaker) a broad range of terms that may be included or excluded in a trust. A person establishing a trust may specify in the instrument the rights, powers, duties, limitations, and immunities applicable to the trustee, beneficiary, and others, and those provisions, where not otherwise contrary to law, shall control. 760 ILCS 3/815(a)(1). For any powers that the trust creator does not specifically state or exclude in the trust document, the statute provides a list of powers (by default) that allows the trustee to act. These powers include but are not limited to:• To sell, contract to sell, or exchange, or all or part of the trust estate at public or private sale, for cash or on credit• To borrow money and mortgage or pledge all or part of the trust estate• To grant easements and subdivide or improve real estate• To appoint a trustee to act in other jurisdictions• To open bank accounts and safe deposit boxes• To exercise voting rights or give proxies on securities• To pay taxes and expenses incurred in administering the trust estate• To appoint attorneys, accountants, and financial advisors and pay reasonable compensation to the appointees• To delegate to a co-trustee for any period of time any or all of the trustee's rights, powers, and duties• To compromise, contest, prosecute, or abandon claims in favor of the trust estate• To sign contracts, notes, conveyances, and other instruments• To receive additional trust property• To invest in or hold undivided interests in property• To deal with the executor, trustee, or other representative of any other trust or estate where the trust is a beneficiary or has an interest in• To make distributions in cash or in kind• To rely on an affidavit, certificate, or letter reasonably believed to be genuine to make payments or distributions in good faith without liability• To have all the rights, powers, and duties as trustee after the trust is terminated and until distributions or pending litigation is completed• To purchase insurance• To distribute income and principal as the trustee believes to be for the best interests of any beneficiary who is under legal disability or in the trustee's opinion is unable to properly manage his or her affairs• To plant and harvest crops and to breed, raise, purchase, and sell livestock, own and manage farm equipment, buildings, and farmland• To drill for or otherwise own oil, gas, or mineral rights• To operate a business proprietorship• To operate a partnership or corporation owned by the trust • To terminate the trust and distribute the trust estate if the trustee determines, in the trustee's sole discretion, with the consent of the recipients, that the value of the trust is less than $100,000 and that the costs of continuing the trust will substantially impair accomplishment of the purpose of the trustSee 760 ILCS 3/816.In addition to general powers, trustees are granted discretionary powers. The statute provides that a beneficiary who is not the settlor, is acting as a trustee, must make distributions to the beneficiary under ascertainable standards and not to creditors of the beneficiary. 760 ILCS 3/814(b). This allows a beneficiary to serve as a trustee and still be able to protect his or her own trust share under a spendthrift clause.Powers and Duties of a Successor TrusteeIn the event of the death, resignation, refusal, or inability to act of any trustee: • The remaining trustee, if any, shall continue to act, with all the rights, powers, and duties, of all of the trustees –or–• If there is no remaining trustee, a successor trustee may be appointed by a majority in interest of the beneficiaries then entitled to receive the income from the trust estate 760 ILCS 3/812.A successor trustee has all the rights, powers, and duties that are granted to or imposed on the prior trustee. A successor trustee is under no duty to inquire into the acts or doings of a predecessor trustee and is not liable for any act or failure to act of a predecessor trustee. With the approval of a majority in interest of the beneficiaries then entitled to receive the benefit of the trust income, a successor trustee may accept the account rendered and the property received as a full and complete discharge to the predecessor trustee without incurring any liability for doing so. See 760 ILCS 3/812.Duty to Keep Beneficiaries InformedIn theory, the duty to keep beneficiaries informed does not seem terribly complex. The trustee ought to send periodic statements to the beneficiaries so they are aware of the trust's assets and the transactions that are occurring in the trust's account; that way, the beneficiaries can fulfill their fundamental role of enforcing the proper administration of the trust. So how does the attorney advise a client who does not want his or her children to know about the millions of dollars being held in trust for their benefit lest they lose all incentive to be productive members of society? The short answer is that, in Illinois, there is not much that a trustee can do to shield this information from the beneficiaries because secrecy would constitute a breach of the trustee's statutory fiduciary duty.Timeliness of accounting to the beneficiaries is important as by statute, beneficiaries, and heirs of beneficiaries have two years to object to the accounting by a trustee. Once a settlor dies, the successor trustee must inform all beneficiaries of the trust within 90 days, the terms and conditions of the trust. 760 ILCS 3/813.1(b). A trustee must provide an annual accounting to certain beneficiaries 760 ILCS 3/813.1(b)(2). It is important that the trustee keep track of the receipts and disbursements from the time he or she takes over the trust until the trust is finally terminated. Every trustee must, at least annually, furnish a current account showing the receipts, disbursements, and inventory of the trust estate to the beneficiaries then entitled to receive or receiving the income from the trust estate. A current account is binding on the beneficiaries receiving the account and on such beneficiaries' heirs and assigns unless an action against the trustee is instituted by the beneficiary or such beneficiary's heirs and assigns within three years from the date the current account is furnished. Every trustee must, on termination of the trust, furnish to the beneficiaries then entitled to distribution of the trust estate a final account for the period from the date of the last current account to the date of distribution showing the inventory of the trust estate, the receipts, disbursements, and distributions and shall make available to such beneficiaries copies of prior accounts not theretofore furnished. See 760 ILCS 3/813.1(b)(4).If a beneficiary is disabled, the trustee must report to the representative of the estate of a beneficiary under legal disability or a spouse, parent, adult child, or guardian of the person of a beneficiary for whose estate no representative has been appointed, may act for the beneficiary in receiving and approving any account of the trustee appointing a successor trustee and executing any receipt and receiving any notice from the trustee. 760 ILCS 3/813.2(d).Compensation of TrusteeTrustees are entitled to be compensated for administering trusts. For Illinois trusts and trustees, the trustee may be reimbursed for all proper expenses incurred in the management and protection of the trust and is entitled to reasonable compensation for services rendered. See 760 ILCS 3/708(a). For individual trustees, one should consider the nature of the work involved including the time, effort, difficulty, and skills required; compensation customarily charged in the community for similar services; the size of the estate and the results obtained by the trustee's efforts; any time limitations on settling the trust estate or the making of distributions; and the experience and capabilities of the trustee. It is standard practice for corporate trustees to charge commissions at their published rate schedule unless there is an agreement to the contrary. A trustee is also allowed reimbursement of advancement of costs and expenses to administer the trust and protect trust property. 760 ILCS 3/709(a).Related ContentResource Kits• Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (IL)Current as of: 07/01/2025End of Document

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][date][name of client(s)][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:FUNDING YOUR REVOCABLE TRUSTNow that you have established your Revocable Trust, it must be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly and undividedly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.This memorandum provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Revocable Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. I can assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.Please examine your assets to determine which assets to transfer into your Revocable Trust and contact my office if you would like advice about whether to transfer specific assets into the Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, mineral and royalty interests, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the trust during your lifetime(s) include IRAs, 401ks, and some types of annuities.In general, to transfer assets to your Trusts, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually or jointly to the Revocable Trust, as follows:[name of client 1] and [name of client 2] as TRUSTEES of the [name of Revocable Living Trust], dated [date]One of the major goals accomplished by a Revocable Trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate of the trust assets at the time of your deaths. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets be titled in the name of the serving Trustee—as Trustee, not in the Trustee's name individually—of the Revocable Trust and not by you individually and/or jointly, as outlined above. Although your pour-over Will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets (except most real estate) will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust property. To avoid that result, you may wish to retitle all assets in the name of your Revocable Trust as outlined above. Please note, however, that transferring assets into your Revocable Trust will not prevent them from being subject to Federal estate tax, if applicable.You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your estate planning goals. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust. On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature, and if you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Bank Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution. The name on the bank account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the Trust, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.Safety Deposit Box. The lessee of a safety deposit box should be changed or acquired in the name of the Trust to allow the acting Trustee access to the safety deposit box. The bank may require new signature cards.Brokerage Accounts. If you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's name and records must be changed to indicate that the Trustee owns the account on behalf of the Trust, and you do not own it individually. This also applies if the certificates for those assets are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name.Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund Shares. If certificates are issued in your name(s), both individually or jointly, new certificates must be issued to reflect the Trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, in order to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the Trustee during your lifetimes. In the case of private stock in a closely held business, there may be restrictions against transfer in the shareholders agreement, so it should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted.Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof). These securities must also be registered in the name of the Trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed above, if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed. U.S. Savings Bonds series EE and series I are reissued electronically using Form 1851 found at treasurydirect.gov/forms/sav1851.pdf.Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or Debentures. These securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the Trustee, so there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be accomplished by executing and delivering to the Trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust, listing the bearer securities being transferred, which will be retained by the Trustee with the permanent records of the trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. It would be helpful to keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the Trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.Tangible Personal Property including Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects). Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Revocable Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described for unregistered securities. An Assignment of Tangible Personal Property to Revocable Trust can be used to transfer all tangible personal property to the Trust. While the assignment may cover current and later acquired tangible personal property, any new tangible investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the Trustee, as Trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the Trustee's ownership.Motor Vehicles and Mobile Homes. Motor Vehicles and Mobile Homes could be transferred to the Trust. It is recommended to consider transferring such assets to the Trust unless it has very little value, or unless you plan to dispose of it imminently. The state Department of Motor Vehicles handles the transfer of vehicle and mobile home title transfers. Be prepared to present the current title certificate(s) and Certification of Trust to effectuate the transfer. If the vehicle is subject to a loan, you should check with the lender regarding their requirements for a transfer of the vehicle securing the loan.Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership). In order to register these partnership interests in the Trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest, assignment, or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed prior to initiating a transfer.Limited Liability Company (LLC). An LLC Operating Agreement may include provisions for disposition of membership interest upon the death of a member. A membership interest in an LLC may be transferred into the name of the Trust, if appropriate, which requires either amending the LLC Operating Agreement or an assignment of the membership interest, or both, if permitted by the LLC Operating Agreement.Real Property (Personal Residence, Investment Real Estate, and Mineral and Royalty Interests). To transfer real property into the Trust, legal title must be transferred to the Trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a Quitclaim Deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.Please note that title to real property vests immediately upon death in the name of the beneficiary under the will or heir. Therefore, unless such property is needed to pay debts of the estate, the real property does not pass through probate.Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan Benefits. Ownership of these assets should not be transferred to a Revocable Trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the Trustee for distribution under the terms of the trust. Life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate unless all designated beneficiaries predecease the policyholder depending on the terms of the policy. You may wish to transfer ownership to your Revocable Trust to give the Trustee more control over the policies in case your designated beneficiaries predecease you or you become incapacitated.Ownership of IRAs and 401ks should not be transferred to the Trust. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan Trustee to name the Trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if put into the Revocable Trust, so caution is advised.If a bank, financial institution, or other governing body requires evidence of the Revocable Trust to complete the transfer, use the Certification of Trust rather than producing a copy of the entire trust agreement. The Certification of Trust provides only the necessary information without disclosing confidential details.Once an asset has been transferred to the Trustee of your Revocable Trust, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the Trustee, rather than by you individually and/or jointly (even if you are the initial Trustees of the Revocable Trust). For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the Trustee, it is the Trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the Trustee.Additional assets may be transferred to your Revocable Trust either by registering them in the name of the Trustee, by delivering them to the Trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the Trustee, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from your Revocable Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawal. The Trust Agreement can be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement.Federal income tax returns for a Revocable Trust are not required. If the Settlor or Settlors are also the Trustee or a co-Trustee, a federal tax identification number for the trust is also not necessary, and all income is reported using the Settlor's or Settlors' social security numbers (which becomes the Revocable Trust's taxpayer identification number). If the Settlor or Settlors are not Trustees, the Settlor's or Settlors' social security numbers can still be used, but the Trustee must meet certain other requirements in that case. After the Settlor's or Settlors' death, a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the Trust.Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your trust or about the operation of the trust in the future. This memorandum is for your general guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.

Funding Revocable Trusts (NY)
Go to: The Importance of Funding a Revocable Living Trust   |   How to Transfer or Place Specific Assets into a Revocable Living Trust   |   Other Funding IssuesMaintainedby Michael Bond, Law Office of Michael BondThis practice note contains information and instructions on funding a revocable trust in New York. One of the primary benefits of a revocable living trust is that, if fully and properly funded during the grantor's lifetime, probate can be avoided. Therefore, it is vitally important to transfer all of a settlor's assets into the trust, ideally soon after the creation of the trust, and then on an ongoing basis as needed throughout the grantor's lifetime.Trust funding must be taken seriously and professionally, as errors can result in client complaints and malpractice claims. Some attorneys choose not to involve themselves in the funding process. Others assume responsibility for certain tasks and not for others. To the extent possible, you should determine with your client in advance who will be responsible for which tasks and clearly explain that all tasks other than those you expressly agree to undertake will be the responsibility of the client unless you subsequently agree otherwise (ideally in writing). In situations where the client is to perform some or all funding tasks, you may wish to send a follow up/reminder letter approximately 60 days after the trust is created to reiterate the importance of funding the trust and to see if they wish to involve your help with any remaining tasks. If you choose not to take on the responsibility of funding the trust for your client, or if the client declines your offer to help, you should at least provide explicit instructions about the process to the client.This practice note offers guidance to you when funding a revocable living trust for your clients, as well as when advising your clients as to how they should fund it.For a full listing of key content related to estate plans for married or partnered people in New York, see Estate Plan for Individual with Spouse or Partner Resource Kit (NY).For related practice notes, see Characteristics and Uses of Trusts (NY); Requirements and Restrictions on Trust Purposes and Administration (NY); and Revocation, Amendment, and Termination of Trusts (NY).The Importance of Funding a Revocable Living TrustA grantor's assets must be transferred into the trust if it is to achieve one of its objectives: to simplify the transfer and administration of assets after the settlor's death. It is also necessary because the trustee only has control of the property if it is in the trust. If the grantor becomes incapacitated, the chosen successor trustee(s) will be able to continue managing trust assets without court involvement or other difficulty if the grantor's assets are in the trust at that time.To the extent that the settlor does not transfer assets into the trust, those assets will not escape probate. That is why a pour-over will should always be prepared along with the trust agreement to direct that any assets not held by the trust at the time of the grantor's death be transferred into the trust so that they will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the trust. However, a probate proceeding will be necessary to accomplish this.How to Transfer or Place Specific Assets into a Revocable Living TrustThe following items are assets that are commonly held by a grantor. You should be mindful to get a clear and accurate picture of the types of assets your client owns so you can provide appropriate advice and try to ensure everything that must be transferred to the trust actually gets transferred.Personal ResidenceIn most cases, the grantor's interest in his or her home should be transferred from their own name to the name of the trustee (usually, the client), as trustee. Recording a bargain and sale deed and filing any necessary transfer tax forms will achieve this purpose. For a modest fee, a title insurance company can help make sure everything is done properly and efficiently. If the client undertakes this task, you should ask to be sent a copy of the recorded deed.A few special points about the transfer of a residence or any other real property into a revocable living trust:• There will be no reassessment because the transfer of real property to a revocable trust is not a "change in ownership" for property tax purposes.• There will be no transfer tax because the property has not been sold. However, appropriate transfer tax forms will need to be filed, indicating that it is a transfer for no consideration to a revocable trust.• While it is not legally required that the new deed be recorded right away, it is highly advisable to do so unless the terms of any mortgage contain language that makes it unwise. For example, most mortgage agreements have what is called an acceleration or "due on sale" clause, which means that the full balance on the mortgage becomes immediately due if there is a change in ownership. Since transferring the home into the trust isn't a change of ownership of the type a due on sale clause is meant to address, you or the client should contact the lender, explain what you are trying to do, and confirm that the due on sale clause won't be triggered. Ideally, you or the client will get this in writing from the lender.Cooperative or Condominium ApartmentsIf the client has such an ownership interest, you or the client should ask the manager of the cooperative or condominium about how it should be transferred into the trust. It is likely the management will have various formalities and fees associated with the transfer, but it is nevertheless important that the transfer be made. Please also note that if the client chooses to refinance their mortgage after transferring the cooperative apartment or condominium into the trust, they may have to transfer it out of the trust in order to refinance and then transfer it back into the trust after the refinance is complete. You or the client should always consult with the lender when making these types of changes to ensure compliance with the terms of the loan agreement.Other Real PropertyA new deed is required for every other piece of real property that the client owns. As noted above, it may be necessary to obtain the permission of the lender to transfer the property into the trust. If the other real property is located in another state, you or the client should consult an attorney in that state to assist in transferring that property, as different states have different rules and customs. If your client purchases real estate in the future, he or she should generally take title in his or her trustee capacity. If the client fails to do so, the new property must go through the probate process.Savings Accounts and Certificates of DepositThese accounts should be held by the trustee as trustee of the revocable trust. Banks and similar institutions commonly see revocable trusts and are used to helping their customers with necessary changes. A copy of the trust instrument or Memorandum of Trust is usually required. Note that a Memorandum of Trust is also sometimes called a Certificate of Trust or an Affidavit of Trust. See Certificate of Trust (NY) for a sample certificate of trust form. Suggest that the bank make a copy if they require it for their records. The client should keep a copy of any new card or document that they sign to effect the change. If a particular savings account cannot be transferred before a set date without losing interest, the client may decide to wait. It may be necessary to wait until a Certificate of Deposit's maturity date before it can be retitled.Checking AccountsWhile such accounts can and, in almost all cases, should be put into the name of the trust, the client may want, for a special reason, to leave one account in his or her name as an individual. However, any such account should maintain a low balance. Bank records must indicate that accounts are held in the name of the trust, but personal checks can be printed with the client's name only, without reference to the trust.Life Insurance PoliciesYou or the client must contact their insurance agent or the company itself to obtain their "Change of Beneficiary" and "Change of Ownership" forms. In many cases, the owner and the beneficiary should be the trust. Because these changes are not effective until they are received and acknowledged by insurance companies, you or the client should take care of this as soon as possible. Be sure to receive written confirmation from the insurance company that the desired changes have been effected in company records and by endorsement on the policy.If the client has personal reasons for naming a particular individual as beneficiary, he or she certainly may do so. This means that the proceeds of the policy will be distributed directly to the named beneficiaries, and not according to the terms of the trust. There are differing opinions and considerations on whether to name individuals or the trust as the primary beneficiary of life insurance policies, and these opinions and considerations should be discussed with the client to determine the primary beneficiary of such policies. For example, if the client wants an outright distribution of insurance proceeds to a named beneficiary who is an adult, and feels that person should have access to those proceeds quickly, then naming the individual as a beneficiary instead of the trust might be advisable. Also, while creditors often can go after insurance proceeds to satisfy any debts of the deceased grantor, it is perhaps less likely that will happen if the proceeds pay out directly to a named beneficiary as opposed to them being paid out to the trust.Insurance on Property Held by the TrustInsurance contracts that provide for payments to be made if there is loss or damage to assets held in trust (e.g., title insurance and homeowners insurance) should be amended. You or the client should ask their insurance agent to have the policy or policies amended. The trustee(s) and the trust should be named as additional insured parties, using the "name" suggested under Other Funding Issues below.The grantor, as an individual, should continue to be named as an insured party even though the trust and trustee are added as additional insured parties.Stock/SecuritiesThe transfer of stock to the trust must be accomplished by changing title on the stock certificates themselves. The client's broker can help make this change for free or for a small charge per certificate. If your client holds shares through a brokerage firm, the client will need to change the title on only the brokerage accounts, rather than on each share certificate.The stockbroker may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by his or her firm's legal department. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers should be sufficient to demonstrate that the trust is properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. Alternatively, you or the client may be able to simply provide a copy of the Memorandum of Trust.If the client holds shares in a closely held corporation, the corporation's secretary should issue new certificates in the name of the trust. The existing (old) certificates should then be canceled. Before this is done, however, it should be determined whether there is a stock restriction agreement, whether an assignment might cause some sort of forfeiture, and whether the board must approve the transfer. It would be wise to consult with corporate counsel in this regard.You or the client should send any stock certificates via registered mail, return receipt requested, with enough insurance to cover the replacement bond, in case the certificates are lost in the mail. The amount of this bond can be obtained from the brokerage, and it guards against someone else trying to transfer the certificates if they somehow fall into someone else's hands.PartnershipsPartnership interests can be complicated. A limited partnership agreement may indicate what is needed to transfer the interest. Such an agreement should be reviewed to determine (1) whether or not the client can transfer his or her interest into the trust and, if so, (2) how to achieve this result.Promissory NotesThe client should assign each promissory note he or she owns to the trust. The client can do so by typing on the back of each note the following endorsement:Pay to the order of ______________________, Trustee under ______________________ Trust Agreement Dated ______________________ ______________________.Go to table1The client should also assign the deeds of trust securing payment of the notes to the trust. You or the client need not record the assignment, but it should be prepared in the same manner as deeds to real property and should be retained in a safe place. If the trustee or a successor trustee needs to commence any action to obtain title to the property given as the security for payment of the note, the assignment can be recorded.IRAsIRAs must be held in the name of the individual who created the account. The client names beneficiaries on a "designation of beneficiary" form provided by the financial institution. Normally, a married person will name his or her spouse as the first beneficiary and, as alternate beneficiary, either the trust or individuals. Individuals as beneficiaries may have a few more tax elections than the trust will have. Naming the trust as beneficiary will have less such options, but would ensure that the proceeds of the account pay to beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the trust.Retirement BenefitsRetirement benefits require special consideration since both the form of benefit and the choice of beneficiary affect the client's estate plan and can have significant tax consequences. These choices also have a major impact on married persons' lives in the event one spouse enters a nursing home. The client should consult with the plan administrator about the options available now and in the future. The necessary forms may require specific wording in order for your married clients to be eligible for the marital deduction and other benefits.If your client's employment terminated before 1985, he or she may be entitled to certain important tax advantages. The client should review his or her benefits with a pension specialist prior to making any changes to the retirement benefits.Normally a married client should first designate his or her spouse as beneficiary of qualified plan benefits.AutomobilesIt may not be advisable to transfer automobiles to the trust. If, however, your client has a number of automobiles, or ones of particularly high value, these should be transferred to the trust. Automobiles should not be transferred to the trust unless the client is certain that adequate liability insurance is available to cover substantial claims, as the trust may be made a party to any lawsuits following an accident involving an automobile that the trust holds as the owner. If automobiles are to be transferred to the trust, your client should contact the appropriate state licensing agency for the vehicle and seek instructions on how to effectuate the transfer of title to the trust. He or she should also contact the insurance carrier for the vehicle to ensure the vehicle will continue to be covered once it is placed in the trust.Lease AgreementsThe lease under which your client is the lessor should be assigned to the trust using an Assignment of Lease. Your client should notify the lessee in writing that all future rental checks should be made payable directly to the trust, not to your client individually.Cemetery PlotsYou or the client should transfer his or her cemetery plot to the trust. This is typically done through executing an Assignment of Burial Plots & Mausoleum. The director of the cemetery should receive a copy of this Assignment.Safe Deposit BoxYour client can transfer his or her safe deposit box by assigning the rights under the existing rental agreement to the trust or by having the trust itself enter into a new rental agreement with the bank. It is also a good idea for your client to give the successor trustee authority to access the box so that if your client should become incapacitated or even deceased, the successor trustee can get into the box.U.S. Savings BondsThe federal government requires the use of Form PD 1851 for transferring U.S. Savings Bonds. The back of the form has instructions. After you or the client have filled out the form, the client's signature must be "guaranteed" (medallion stamped) by an officer at his or her bank and forwarded along with the bonds to the following. For EE or I savings bonds: Treasury Retail Securities Services, PO Box 214, Minneapolis, MN 55480-0214; for HH savings bonds: Treasury Retail Securities Services, PO Box 2186, Minneapolis, MN 55480-2186..Other Personal PropertyProperty such as airplanes, yachts, horses, art work, copyrights, patents, or royalty contracts, a family business, stock options, mobile homes, partnership interests, and other rare types of property have special considerations that should be researched to determine if and how to transfer such property into the trust.Personal property items (household furniture and furnishings, books, pictures, jewelry, hobby equipment and collections, wearing apparel, and other articles of household or personal use or ornament, etc.) can be transferred by a general assignment with particular descriptions of valuable items and a provision to cover after-acquired items.Other Funding IssuesIn What "Name" Should Trust Assets Be Held?Generally speaking, assets will be retitled in substantially the following format:[Trustee name], Trustee under [trust name] Trust Agreement Dated [month day, year].It presents no problems if a bank or any other financial institution wants to hold an asset in a slightly different name. The important thing is to be sure that the trust is not confused with any other trust and that the assets are clearly held in the trust.Income Tax ReturnsAt the time the trust is established, your client should inform his or her accountant.As long as the grantor serves as the trustee (which is usually the case), he or she will use their Social Security Number as the number for the trust. Your client will file the same income tax return he or she has always filed. If a successor trustee takes over, a tax identification number must be obtained so that the trust can file an income tax return. The trust will, in effect, file a return with the same information and pay no more taxes than your client pays now, but the information will be reported on an IRS form designed for trustees and fiduciaries.The successor trustee will use IRS Form SS-4 to obtain the new tax identification number. When the number is received, it should be communicated to the client's accountant or tax preparer, as it will be used on the tax return to be signed by the trustee.RecordkeepingNo extraordinary recordkeeping is necessary beyond that which your client would ordinarily maintain. It is important, however, that the client keep records of trust property separate from property that may not be in the trust. Once changes in ownership to the trust are made, your client will receive monthly and other account statements in the name of the trust. Information your client receives from his or her stockbroker or other sources of financial information should also be adequate.Preparation of Schedule AYou or your client should prepare a Schedule A listing all assets transferred to the trust. Examples of these listings are:• 100 shares, P, G & E, common• Real property at 0000 High Street, Palo Alto, California –and–• Limited partnership interest in XXX Fund 1 unitFuture Changes in Trust AssetsIf the trust should subsequently dispose of a listed asset, it may be removed from the schedule by keeping a separate schedule and indicating its disposition and the date it was disposed of. Schedule A as originally prepared need not be changed, as it only indicates assets as of a particular day. As assets are removed, your client should simply keep a record of the change. Likewise, if a new asset is acquired by the trust, it may be added to a new schedule.The client should review the schedule of trust assets each year when income tax returns are prepared. Delete what has been sold. Add what has been acquired and confirm that it is held in the name of the trust.Future Trust AdministrationThe focus at the time the trust is created is funding the trust and administering it during your client's lifetime. At death, certain trust administrative procedures are required, and consultation by the successor trustee with an attorney will likely be necessary. If the trust has been properly funded, the cost of trust administration will be significantly less than probate. Furthermore, if the trust contains provisions for an A/B trust, significant tax savings and other benefits are likely. You may also wish to suggest that your client create a list of their professional advisers (e.g., you, their financial planner, their CPA/tax preparer, etc.), as well as the institutions holding the grantor's assets—along with contact information for each—and keep it with their trust records. This can be of great benefit to successor trustees who may not be familiar with the grantor's assets and who to contact about those assets.Current as of: 03/21/2025

Memorandum to Client 
  Thank you for the opportunity to be of service to you as the trustee of the [Trust Name] Special Needs Trust [dated] ("Trust"). The first thing you must do as Trustee is fund the Trust. Any asset transferred to the Trust should be titled as [Trustee Name(s)], Trustee(s) of the [Trust Name] Special Needs Trust, Dated [Day], [Month], [Year].1. Funding.(a) California Real Property. To transfer California real property into the Trust a deed must be recorded with the County Recorder's Office. We prepared the deed for your property, which you signed when you signed the Trust and agreed to serve as Trustee. We will record the deed. Please note that because no exclusion from reassessment for property tax applies, there will be a reassessment of property tax basis by the county and applicable property taxes will be due and payable. We also suggest you contact the homeowner's insurance company to add the Trust as an additional insured on the homeowner's insurance policy.(b) Tax Identification. This Trust is irrevocable and will be required to file tax returns, to that end, you will need to obtain a tax identification number for the Trust. You may obtain the tax number by going to the IRS website and completing the form for an EIN, requesting the assistance of a competent tax advisor of your choice, or we can obtain the number for you. The IRS does not charge a fee to obtain the tax id number. Beware of websites that offer to obtain the number for you for a fee. The tax id will also be needed for banks and investment accounts. Do not use your own social security number, the beneficiary's social security number, and do not use [a/the] settlor's social security number, as the Trust needs to have its own tax id number.(c) Personal Property – Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts and Investment Accounts. You will need to provide a Certification of Trust [which we have provided for you] and tax identification number to the banks to transfer and/or open bank accounts for the Trust. Provide the banks with a copy of the Certification and be sure to keep the original or provide the original Certification of Trust to be inspected by the financial institution and ask the financial institutions to make a copy for their records and to return the original to you. Although the banks are obligated by California law to accept the Certification of Trust we provided to you, the banks often have their own trust certification form for you to complete. If you elect to use their form (for administrative ease) and you need assistance with their form or with funding the trust, please do not hesitate to contact our office.2. Administration.This Trust was created to provide [beneficiary name] a comfortable life, while not putting their governmental benefits in jeopardy. As long as they are receiving any governmental benefits which are needs-based (i.e., have income and resource limitations) you should not pay any of the following expenses from the Trust:(a) Food(b) Shelter – including mortgage, real property taxes, and rent(c) Utilities – gas, electricity, water, sewer, and garbage removalThe governmental benefits are meant to cover these expenses and any payment of these expenses by the Trust could result in the loss or reduction of benefits.You may pay from the Trust the following:(a) Telephone, cable, and internet services(b) Entertainment, such movies, museums, theater(c) Furniture(d) Medical equipment not covered by any other benefit(e) Caregiver/companion not covered by any other benefit, but certain rules must be complied with.  If you are considering hiring caregivers, please discuss with our office prior to doing so in order to better understand the applicable rules.Please do not hesitate to reach out to our office if you have any questions regarding a specific disbursement from the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary.Federal and State income tax returns must be filed annually. Under the terms of the Trust you may hire a CPA/tax accountant to prepare the returns for you. The annual income tax returns are specialized returns and we recommend that you consult with a competent tax advisor of your choice.If you have any questions regarding the funding or administration of the Trust, please do not hesitate to call us. We look forward to working with you during the administration of the [Trust Name] Special Needs Trust.End of Document

Letter to Client 
[name of law firm][law firm address][law firm phone number][Month Day, 20__][name of client][address]RE: Funding of Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:  Now that you have established your Revocable Trust(s), the Trust should be funded by transferring ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. If you own any assets jointly with one or more persons and wish to transfer those assets into your Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance. After such transfer, only the person(s) who are Trustees of the Trust are considered owners.  You should examine your asset list to determine which assets to transfer. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property in any and all states, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, savings accounts, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the Trust during your lifetime include IRAs and some types of annuities.  In general, to transfer assets to your Trust, you will need to change the title for each asset from your names individually (or jointly) to each Trust, as follows:"[Name of Trustee], as Trustee of the [name of Grantor] Revocable Living Trust, dated [month day, 20__]."  The enclosed memorandum describes in detail the steps necessary to transfer many kinds of assets to your Trusts. Of course, the specific steps to accomplish this transfer will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please call me. I can then contact the appropriate entities to obtain the paperwork and transfer requirements from them and prepare deeds and other documents that must be recorded.  Now that we have completed your planning, I am enclosing my firm invoice for services rendered in that regard. I believe that the statement is self-explanatory, and merely reflects the quoted fee and costs, but certainly if you have any questions about it, please let me know.  Thank you for the opportunity to work with you on your planning. Again, if you have any questions about the Trusts, or the transfer of assets to them, please call.Funding Your Revocable Trust:A Note to My ClientFrom [Attorney Name], Esq.  A major purpose of using a revocable trust as the main instrument in your estate plan is to avoid probate on the trust assets at your death. In order to avoid probate, it is critically important that assets be owned by the trustee of the revocable trust and not by you individually. Although your pour-over will provides that assets held in your individual name at your death will be added to the trust assets and distributed as provided in your trust, those assets will be subject to probate before they are added to the trust. To avoid that result, assets you intend to place in the trust should be titled in the name of the trustee, for example, "Jane Doe, as trustee of the Jane Doe Revocable Living Trust, dated August 23, 2017."  You should carefully and continually review the assets held in your own names (both assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this is consistent with your desire to avoid probate. As a married couple, one major consideration in transferring a jointly held asset into one of your revocable trusts is that the asset will lose creditor protection afforded by Florida law to assets held jointly by married couples, known as tenancy by the entireties. I will be glad to discuss the advisability of retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, holding assets in joint names with another person, or transferring assets to the trustee of your revocable trust. Generally speaking, unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, I do not recommend that your personal checking or small savings accounts, or tangible personal property (jewelry, automobiles, etc.) be transferred to the trust. Please feel free to call me to discuss whether my general recommendation applies to your particular situation.  On the following pages, I offer some general guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your trust. Those comments are general in nature, and I suggest that you consult me before funding your trust.1. Accounts or Certificates Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution  The name on the account or certificate must be changed to reflect its ownership by the trustee, and a new passbook or certificate must be issued in the name of the trustee. Be careful to confirm with the financial institution before transferring a savings certificate that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.2. Brokerage Accounts  If you own stocks, bonds, or other securities through a brokerage account, and if the certificates for those assets are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name, the brokerage firm's records must be changed to indicate that the trustee owns the account and not you individually.3. Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations) or Mutual Fund Shares  If certificates are issued in your name, new certificates must be issued to reflect the trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you might consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, in order to trace your income tax basis in any shares sold by the trustee during your lifetime.4. Registered Bonds or Debentures Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof)  These securities must also be registered in the name of the trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with stock certificates discussed in paragraph 3., if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed.5. Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or Debentures  These securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the trustee, so that there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be done by executing and delivering to the trustee a transfer document listing the bearer securities being transferred, which document will be retained by the trustee with the permanent records of the trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. It would be helpful to keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.6. Tangible Investment Assets (Such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects, Etc.)  Because there is no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to the trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described in paragraph 5. for bearer securities. Any new investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the trustee with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the trustee's ownership.7. Partnership Interests (Whether in a General Partnership or Limited Partnership)  In order to register these property interests in the trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. There may be restrictions against transfer in the partnership agreement, so it should be reviewed before transfer.8. Interests in Real Property (Personal Residence or Investment Real Estate)  Legal title must be transferred to the trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a special warranty deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any "due on sale" clause in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply carefully with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. A land trust deed under Fla. Stat. § 689.071 may be advisable. You should consult with me before deeding any real property (especially a residence in Florida) into the trust. I do not recommend transferring your primary Florida residence into the trust while both spouses are living.9. Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan Benefits  Ownership of these assets is generally not transferred to a revocable trust, but the death benefits can be made payable to the trustee, if desired, for distribution under the terms of the trust. Although life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, ownership can be transferred to the trust to give the trustee more control over the policies in case you become disabled. Ownership of IRAs should not be transferred to the trust. Change-of-beneficiary forms from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and recorded with the insurer or the plan trustee to name the trustee of your trust as the beneficiary of any benefits. Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if put into the trust, so caution is advised.  Once an asset has been transferred to the trustee of your revocable trust, all transactions regarding that property must be handled by the trustee, rather than by you individually (even if you are the trustee of the trust). For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the trustee, it is the trustee who has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting. Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the trustee.  Additional assets may be transferred to the trust either by registering them in the name of the trustee, by delivering them to the trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the trustee, or with other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type. Withdrawals of property from the trust must comply with the provisions of the trust agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawal. The trust can be amended, of course, or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the trust agreement.  Federal income tax returns for a revocable trust are not required during the grantor's lifetime. During the grantor's lifetime, a federal tax identification number for the trust is also not necessary, and all income is reported using the grantor's social security number (which becomes the trust's taxpayer identification number). After the grantor's death, a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the trust.  Please call me if you have any questions about the transfer of property to your trust or about the operation of the trust in the future. This memorandum is for your guidance only and does not encompass all possible situations.

Letter to Client 
[Month] [Day], [Year][name of client][address]Re: Transferring Assets to Your Revocable TrustDear [name of client(s)]:Now that you, as Settlor or Grantor, have established your Revocable Trust, it is time for the next step: transferring the ownership of some or all of your assets to the Trust. Keep in mind that the terms of the Trust only apply to assets that have been transferred to it. Thus, the assets that are  "owned by the trust" are the only assets that the trustee has control over.This letter provides a general description of the steps necessary to transfer various kinds of assets to your Revocable Trust. The specific steps necessary to accomplish these transfers will depend on the nature of the asset involved. If you would like assistance with any of these transfers, please contact my office. We can guide and assist you in the asset transfer process, including the preparation of deeds and obtaining and filing necessary documentation.First, review your assets to determine which ones you would like to transfer into your Revocable Trust. The types of assets that may be transferred include stocks, bonds, real property located in any state or country, tangible personal property, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, life insurance policies, corporate or partnership interests, outstanding notes, and any other type of ownership interests you may hold. Assets that cannot be transferred to the Trust during your lifetime include IRAs and some types of annuities.If you own any assets jointly with one or more persons, and wish to transfer those assets into your Revocable Trust, all of the joint title owners will have to join in the conveyance.In addition to being the Settlor or Grantor of your Revocable Trust, you may also be a trustee. The trustee is considered to be the legal owner of the assets in the Trust. Therefore, to transfer assets to your Trust, you will need to change the title for each asset from your individual name (or names, if the asset is owned jointly) to the name of the trustee of the Revocable Trust. Here is the model for new title of an asset:[name of client 1] [and [name of client 2]] as TRUSTEE[S] of the [name of revocable living trust], dated [Month] [Day], [Year] and any amendments theretoFor example:Individual Trust: John Jones and Jane Smith, as TRUSTEES of the John Jones Revocable Living Trust, dated September 24, 2022, and any amendments theretoJoint Trust: John Jones and Jane Smith, as TRUSTEES of the John Jones and Jane Smith Revocable Living Trust, dated September 24, 2022, and any amendments thereto.It bears repeating that the only assets not subject to probate at your death are the ones you have transferred to your Revocable Trust during your lifetime (in addition to assets which have their own beneficiary designations, such as insurance policies, annuities and retirement plans). Although your Will may state that any assets held in your individual name at your death (such as tangible personal property) will be added to the Trust by your executor and distributed as provided in your Trust Agreement, those assets will be subject to probate before they can be added to the trust property. Although probate in Pennsylvania is not as expensive or as arduous as in many other states, you may nevertheless wish to retitle as many assets as possible in the name of your Revocable Trust during your lifetime.You should carefully review the assets you continue to hold in your own name(s) (i.e., assets that you now own and any that you acquire later) to be certain that this approach is consistent with your estate planning goals. I would be glad to discuss the advisability of (a) retaining ownership of various assets in your name alone, (b) holding assets jointly with another person, or (c) transferring assets to the trustee of your Revocable Trust. In the following paragraphs, I offer guidance on transferring specific types of assets to your Revocable Trust. These comments are general in nature and do not cover every possible circumstance. If you require specific guidance, please contact my office.Instructions on Transferring Assets to A Revocable Trust:• Accounts or Certificates of Deposit Issued by a Bank or Other Savings Institution. The name on the account or certificate of deposit must be changed to reflect its ownership by the trustee, and, if applicable, a new passbook (or its equivalent) or certificate of deposit must be issued in the name of the trustee. Most financial institutions will require the use of their own forms. Before transferring a certificate of deposit to your trust, confirm with the financial institution that there will be no penalty for early withdrawal.• Brokerage Accounts or Mutual Fund Shares. If you own stocks, bonds, mutual funds or other securities through a brokerage account, the brokerage firm's records must be changed to indicate that it is the trustee who now owns the account, not you individually. This also applies to shares that are not issued in your name but are held instead in a street name or in the brokerage firm's name. The financial institution will probably require the use of its own forms to effect this change.• Corporate Stocks (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations). If certificates are issued in your individual or joint name(s),  new certificates must be issued to reflect the trustee's ownership of the stock or shares. You may be able to combine all certificates representing shares in one corporation into one new certificate, but you may wish to consider requesting a series of new certificates, one corresponding to each old certificate, in order to trace your income tax basis if any shares are sold by the trustee during your lifetime(s).• Registered Bonds or Debentures (Issued by Publicly or Privately Held Corporations, the U.S. Government, an Agency, any State, or Subdivision thereof). These securities must also be registered in the name of the trustee and new bonds or debentures reissued. As with the stock certificates discussed above, if bonds or debentures are held in a brokerage account, title to the account must be changed.• Unregistered or Bearer Bonds or Debentures. These securities, typically issued by the United States government, an agency, a state, or a municipality, generally cannot be registered in the name of the trustee, so there must be some other evidence that these securities have been transferred. This can be accomplished by executing and delivering to the trustee an Assignment to Revocable Trust, listing the bearer securities being transferred, which will be retained by the trustee with the permanent records of the Trust. I can prepare for you any documents necessary to accomplish the transfer. To ensure safekeeping, keep bearer securities in a safe deposit box in the name of the trustee with a duplicate copy of the transfer document attached.• Tangible Investment Assets (such as Gold Bullion, Silver Coins, Art Objects, etc.). Because there is often no proof of registration or ownership of these assets, their transfer to your Revocable Trust should be handled in a manner similar to that described above for unregistered bonds. Any new investments of this type should be purchased directly in the name of the trustee, with the confirmation or other purchase slip retained with the instrument or investment to prove the trustee's ownership.• Partnership Interests (General Partnership or Limited Partnership). In order to register partnership interests in the trustee's name, a new certificate of partnership interest or an amendment to the partnership agreement may need to be executed. The partnership agreement should be reviewed before the transfer is attempted to make sure that it does not contain restrictions against transfer.• Interests in Real Property (Personal Residence and Other Real Estate Interests). Legal title must be transferred to the trustee by means of an executed, notarized, and recorded deed, usually a Special Warranty Deed. Be careful to determine whether any existing mortgage or deed of trust secured by the transferred real estate will be affected by the proposed transfer, and whether the proposed transfer will trigger any due on sale clauses in the mortgage or deed of trust. It is important to comply with the requirements of the law of the state where the property is located. You may wish to consult with a title agent or attorney in that state to ensure that the property interest is eligible for transfer.• Beneficiary-Designated Assets, Such As Life Insurance Policies, Annuities, and Retirement Plan Benefits. The death benefits of these assets can be made payable to the trustee, if desired, for distribution under the terms of the Trust. However, please consult with me before taking this step, because these transfers may involve unexpected complications.• Life insurance policies generally pass outside of probate, just as revocable trusts do. Thus, in most cases life insurance policies are not transferred to revocable trusts. However, if there is a need to grant the trustee of your Revocable Trust control over the policy distributions, or if you fear you may become disabled and unable to administer your life insurance policy, you may wish to transfer ownership of the policy to the trustee of your Revocable Trust.• IRAs and 401Ks should never be transferred to a revocable trust during the Settlor's lifetime. You may, however, wish to consult with me about the feasibility of establishing a trust to hold retirement assets inherited by your beneficiaries.• Some annuities do not permit transfers, and others have negative tax consequences if transferred to a revocable trust. I would be happy to review your annuity contract and, if necessary, consult with the insurance company or plan trustee to determine whether your annuity is transferrable.Change-of-beneficiary forms obtained directly from the insurance company or the administrator of the retirement plan must be completed and registered with the insurer or the plan trustee to name the trustee of your Revocable Trust as the beneficiary of any eligible benefits.Any document evidencing the transfer of assets must be signed by the trustee of your Revocable Trust to indicate that the trustee has accepted the transfer. Once an asset has been transferred to the trustee, all transactions regarding that asset must be handled by the trustee, rather than by you in your individual or joint name(s), even if you are the initial trustee(s) of the Revocable Trust. For example, after corporate stock has been transferred to the trustee, the trustee alone has the power to sell, mortgage, or assign those shares of stock or to vote them at a shareholders' meeting.Additional assets may be tranvcsferred to your Revocable Trust either by registering them in the name of the trustee, by delivering them to the trustee with appropriate documents to re-register the assets in the name of the trustee, or by means of other transfer documents if the asset is of the nonregistered type.You may be asked by financial firms to provide a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by their legal departments. In most cases, it is not necessary to provide a copy of the entire trust agreement. A copy of the Certification of Trust or the signature page and the trustee powers provisions should demonstrate to the financial firm's satisfaction that the trust has been properly executed and that the trustee has the necessary powers to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds and options, trade on margin and conduct other trust business.Withdrawals of property from your Revocable Trust must comply with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. I can prepare documents for you to accomplish such withdrawals.Amendment and Revocation of the Trust Agreement. As long as one Grantor is still living, the Trust Agreement can be amended or revoked in its entirety, but any amendment or revocation must comply with the procedural requirements of the Trust Agreement. When the last Grantor dies, the entire trust becomes irrevocable.Taxation of the Trust. As long as one Grantor is living, it will not be necessary to file a separate federal income tax return for the Revocable Trust. All income is reported on a Grantor's individual tax return under their social security number, which is used as the trust's taxpayer identification number. Upon the death of the Grantor (or the deaths of both Grantors, in the case of a joint trust), a federal tax identification number must be obtained for the Trust. This federal tax identification number (TIN) must be used on all tax information related to the Trust.Record Keeping. The trustee has a duty to keep records of trust property separate from property that is not in the Trust. You should keep a list of all assets transferred to the Trust, along with their date of transfer, on a copy of Schedule A of the Trust. If the trustee disposes of an asset, a note to that effect should be made on Schedule A, along with the date of disposition.I hope that this letter answers your most pressing questions. Please call me if you have any additional questions about the transfer of property to your Trust or about the operation of the Trust in the future. Upon the death of a Grantor or a trustee, certain trust administration procedures will be required, and the trustee should consult with an attorney at that time. Bear in mind that this memorandum is for your guidance only and does not discuss all possible situations. Please keep it for future reference.Sincerely yours,[name of attorney]End of Document

Letter to Client 
Table of Contents
Dear [name of client]:I am writing regarding the [name of disabled beneficiary]'s Special Needs Trust Agreement dated [month] [day], [year] (the "Trust"), which we [have prepared / reviewed upon your request].The purpose of this letter is to (1) describe the process of transferring assets into the trust; and (2) discuss what you, as trustee of the Trust, need to address during administration of the Trust. Please keep this letter for future reference.To accomplish the long-term goals for which the trust was created, the trustee must adhere to the terms in the trust document and the tax laws relating to trusts. If you have any questions about the tax laws relating to this trust, please do not hesitate to ask me or the person who prepares the tax returns for the Trust.The Trust describes the powers and duties of the trustee(s). Since not all trust documents (also called trust instruments) contain the same powers, closely review and familiarize yourself with the Trust terms to be certain of your authority, requirements imposed upon you, and options for taking action on behalf of the Trust. Reach out to me with questions about the Trust terms as you review them.The Trust is a First-Party Special Needs Trust, designed to hold assets while preserving [name of disabled beneficiary]'s ability to receive government benefits. The principal government benefit in North Carolina to which [name of disabled beneficiary] is entitled is called Medicaid. Transfers to the Trust can consist of cash, bonds, shares of stock, real property, or personal property, etc., but it is important to note that no additions to the trust can be made on or after the 65th birthday of [name of disabled beneficiary]. Also, once assets are transferred to the Trust, [name of disabled beneficiary] has no control of, right to demand, or ability to withdraw any assets from the Trust.1. Irrevocability of Trust. The trust is an irrevocable trust and cannot be amended, except under limited circumstances to conform with federal or state law. Please contact me if you believe this may be an issue at any time during the administration of the trust.2. Federal Tax Identification Number. Obtain a taxpayer identification number (TIN) for the Trust from the Internal Revenue Service by filing IRS Form SS-4. The TIN serves to keep the trust assets separate from those of the settlor and identifies the trust in bank accounts and tax returns. Do not use your own social security number or the disabled beneficiary's social security number. The Trust must have its own TIN.3. Funding the Trust. The ownership of one or more assets must be transferred to the trustee for the trust to be in effect. The bank or brokerage account or the asset itself, such as shares of stock, should be titled in the name of the trust, as follows: "[Name of trustee], Trustee of the [name of disabled beneficiary] Special Needs Trust dated [month] [day] [year]." (Some banks may want to use a slightly different name.)To transfer funds from checking, savings, and brokerage accounts, the TIN should be provided. A bank or brokerage firm may request a copy of the signed trust instrument for examination by the firm's legal department. We generally do not provide a copy of the entire agreement. A copy of the signature page and the trustee powers will serve to demonstrate that the trust has been properly executed and the trustee has the necessary power to borrow money, buy and sell stocks, bonds, and options, trade on margin, and conduct other trust business. A certification of trust prepared in accordance with North Carolina law may also sometimes be used in lieu of the entire trust agreement.To transfer real estate into the trust, a deed must be executed and recorded granting the property to the trust. We can prepare the deed for the property for signature by [name of disabled beneficiary / name of guardian]. Upon obtaining the necessary signatures, we will record the deed at the county Register of Deeds office. You should contact the homeowner's insurance company to notify them of the title change.4. Administration of the Trust. (a) Taxation of Trust Income. File the IRS Form 1041 and NC Form D-407 to report the income for any year in which the trust has taxable income. These forms are due on April 15 of the year after receipt of the taxable income. We strongly recommend retaining an accountant for preparation of tax returns.(b) Distributions from the Trust. The Trust was created to provide [name of disabled beneficiary] with supplemental means of support in addition to, not as replacement of, [name of disabled beneficiary]'s government benefits. Accordingly, the types of distributions that can be made to the disabled beneficiary are limited. In general, distributions should not be made for basic support, which includes (1) housing (e.g., mortgage, real property taxes, rent, etc.); (2) utilities (e.g., gas, electricity, water, sewer, waste service, etc.) (3) food; (4) clothing; and (5) medical treatment for which public or Medicaid funds are available. The government benefits are meant to cover these expenses and any payment of them using the Trust's funds could result in the loss of benefits. All distributions from the Trust are at the discretion of the trustee. Here are some examples of items for which distributions are permissible:(i) phone, cable, and internet service(ii) entertainment (e.g., concerts, museums, theater, movies, tickets to sports events, subscriptions)(iii) furniture(iv) computer hardware and software(v) education expenses unrelated to room and board (i.e., tuition, books, computers, supplies)(vi) medical equipment not covered by any other benefit(vii) travel(viii) nonfood grocery items (e.g., cleaning supplies, personal hygiene products, tissues)(ix) eyeglasses –and–(x) automobile expensesCash or cash equivalents should not be distributed directly to the beneficiary, even if they are reimbursements or prepayments for acceptable expenditures. Instead, payments should be made directly to third parties. Distributions also should not be made to or for the benefit of anyone other than the beneficiary.If you have any questions about permissible distributions, please do not hesitate to contact me.(c) Recordkeeping. Please keep detailed records of the trust assets, income, and expenditures (including the date, amount, payee, and purpose). You may be required to provide a detailed accounting of the Trust to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) or others entitled to an accounting upon the termination of the Trust.(d) Reimbursement to the NCDHHS. Under North Carolina law, the Trust is required to contain a provision that provides for reimbursement to the NCDHHS, upon the death of the disabled beneficiary, of an amount equal to the total amount of Medical Assistance paid on behalf of the trust beneficiary. You, as trustee, should contact the local NCDHHS office to obtain information on the amount due. The NCDHHS may file a claim against the estate for Medicaid estate recovery for the amounts due as well.5. Termination of the Trust. The trust will terminate if any of the following events occur:(a) There are no more assets in the trust.(b) The disabled beneficiary dies and the assets of the trust, after any required reimbursement to the NCDHHS, are distributed to the beneficiary's descendants or the other contingent beneficiaries named in Paragraph [paragraph number] of the trust.6.

To the extent not otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Trust Agreement.This is the duly authorized Certificate designated as "Asset Backed Certificate" (herein called the "Certificate"). Also issued under the Indenture, dated as of [date], among the Trust, [name of Trust Collateral Agent], as trustee and indenture collateral agent, are [__] classes of Notes designated as "Class [__] Asset Backed Notes" (the "Class [__] Notes"), [revise per capital structure] (the Class [__] Notes,…, the "Notes"). This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement, to which Trust Agreement the holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such holder is bound. The property of the Trust includes a pool of retail installment sale contracts secured by new and used automobiles, vans or light duty trucks (the "Receivables"), all monies due thereunder on or after the Cutoff Date, security interests in the vehicles financed thereby, certain bank accounts and the proceeds thereof, proceeds from claims on certain insurance policies and certain other rights under the Trust Agreement and the Sale and Servicing Agreement, all right, title and interest of the Seller in and to the Purchase Agreement dated as of [date] between [__] and the Seller and all proceeds of the foregoing.The holder of this Certificate acknowledges and agrees that its rights to receive distributions in respect of this Certificate are subordinated to the rights of the Noteholders as described in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Indenture and the Trust Agreement, as applicable.Distributions on this Certificate will be made as provided in the Trust Agreement or any other Basic Document by wire transfer or check mailed to the Certificateholder without the presentation or surrender of this Certificate or the making of any notation hereon. Except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement and notwithstanding the above, the final distribution on this Certificate will be made after due notice by the Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee of the pendency of such distribution and only upon presentation and surrender of this Certificate at the office or agency maintained for the purpose by the Owner Trustee in the Corporate Trust Office.Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed by an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not entitle the holder hereof to any benefit under the Trust Agreement or the Sale and Servicing Agreement or be valid for any purpose.THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

(Reverse of Certificate)The Certificate does not represent an obligation of, or an interest in, the Seller, the Servicer, the Owner Trustee or any Affiliates of any of them and no recourse may be had against such parties or their assets, except as may be expressly set forth or contemplated herein or in the Trust Agreement, the Indenture or the Basic Documents. In addition, this Certificate is not guaranteed by any governmental agency or instrumentality and is limited in right of payment to certain collections with respect to the Receivables, all as more specifically set forth herein and in the Sale and Servicing Agreement. A copy of each of the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Trust Agreement may be examined during normal business hours at the principal office of the Seller, and at such other places, if any, designated by the Seller, by the Certificateholder upon written request.The Trust Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Seller under the Trust Agreement at any time by the Seller and the Owner Trustee with the consent of the Majority Noteholders and the Certificateholder. Any such consent by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and on all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Trust Agreement also permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the consent of the Certificateholder.As provided in the Trust Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer at the offices or agencies of the Certificate Registrar maintained by the Owner Trustee in the Corporate Trust Office, accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the holder hereof or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon a new Certificate evidencing the same aggregate interest in the Trust will be issued to the designated transferee. The initial Certificate Registrar appointed under the Trust Agreement is [name of Owner Trustee]. No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge payable in connection therewith.No sale or transfer of a Certificate shall be permitted (including, without limitation, by pledge or hypothecation), and no such sale or transfer shall be registered by the Certificate Registrar or be effective hereunder, if the sale or transfer thereof increases to more than 99 the sum of the number of Certificateholders.The Owner Trustee and any agent of the Owner Trustee may treat the person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the Owner Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.The obligations and responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement and the Trust created thereby shall terminate upon the payment to the Certificateholder of all amounts required to be paid to it pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the disposition of all property held as part of the Trust. The Seller or the Servicer of the Receivables may at its option purchase the corpus of the Trust at a price specified in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and such purchase of the Receivables and other property of the Trust will effect early retirement of the Certificate; however, such right of purchase is exercisable, subject to certain restrictions, only as of the last day of any Collection Period as of which the Pool Balance is [10]% or less of the Original Pool Balance.[ERISA restrictions may be inserted upon advice of ERISA counsel.]The recitals contained herein shall be taken as the statements of the Depositor or the Servicer, as the case may be, and the Owner Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness thereof. The Owner Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Certificate or of any Receivable or related document.Unless the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been executed by an authorized officer of the Owner Trustee, by manual or facsimile signature, this Certificate shall not entitle the Holder hereof to any benefit under the Trust Agreement or the Sale and Servicing Agreement or be valid for any purpose.

Estate Plan for Single Individual Resource Kit (FL)
Go to: Initial Client Meeting   |   Wills   |   Trusts   |   Disability Planning   |   Powers of AttorneyMaintainedThis resource kit provides guidance on creating an estate plan for a single individual residing in Florida. An estate plan is defined as an arrangement providing for the use, management, investment, conservation, and transfer of an individual's property during the individual’s lifetime or after death. The documents utilized by counsel in creating an estate plan will vary depending on the client's circumstances, family needs, estate size, and wishes, among other things. For example, there may be reasons for a client to create a trust on behalf of their beneficiaries rather than gift assets outright to them, or vice versa. In addition to wills and trusts, there may be a need for medical powers of attorney, financial powers of attorney, or various other estate planning tools. This resource kit includes Practical Guidance materials on these potential options, including detailed practice notes, templates, and checklists.Initial Client MeetingMost estate planning matters begin with information gathering at or immediately before the initial client meeting. The details shared by the client at the beginning of the matter help to determine the appropriate and best estate planning tools for them. It is crucial for counsel to ascertain a client's objectives as well as estate information, and it is good practice for this information to be sought out prior to the initial client meeting by way of an estate planning questionnaire. An estate planning questionnaire will inquire into the client's assets; personal information about things like their children, citizenship, any prior marriages, etc.; and their desired fiduciaries.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through the early stages of crafting an estate plan for your client:Go to table1WillsOnce the client's estate planning objectives are ascertained and the necessary information is gathered, the attorney must consider the proper tools to carry out those objectives. In many instances, more than one estate planning tool can be used to achieve a desired objective. A will is the most basic tool in the estate planner's kit. A will enables the client to designate how their assets should be distributed after death and who should oversee that process. A will may also address certain post-death concerns, such as caring for a minor child. You must remember that this tool works only for assets held in the client's name alone and does not work for assets for which there are beneficiary designations, such as life insurance, or for jointly owned property with a right of survivorship.The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting a will or a codicil for your client:Go to table2TrustsA trust is a legal arrangement pursuant to which a grantor transfers property to a trustee to administer on behalf of one or more beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument. The trustee is the legal owner of the trust assets and is tasked with administering them but does so only on behalf of the beneficiaries. Although trusts can be classified according to a number of criteria, the most important to note are inter vivos trusts or living trusts, which go into effect during the grantor's lifetime and can be either revocable or irrevocable, and testamentary trusts, which go into effect after the grantor dies. There are several reasons why a client may want to include a trust in their estate plan (e.g., avoid probate, hold out of state property, plan for future incapacity, and/or keep asset information private).The following Practical Guidance resources will guide you through drafting or amending a trust for your client:Go to table3Disability PlanningA comprehensive estate plan will likely include provisions outlining what should take place in the event of a client's disability. A health care surrogate designation can be used to authorize a health care agent to make medical or other health care decisions on an individual's behalf. A living will is an advance health care directive that details the medical measures a person does or does not want taken in a variety of potential circumstances. Both instruments serve to ensure an individual's health care wishes are followed if the individual cannot enforce those decisions due to a disability or other circumstance. In addition, certain clients may benefit from guidance concerning elder law planning.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information and guide you through this aspect of a client's estate plan:Go to table4Powers of AttorneyPowers of attorney are often included as part of a client's estate plan. A power of attorney is the legal instrument by which an individual (the principal) authorizes another individual (the attorney-in-fact or agent) to make certain business, financial, and personal decisions on their behalf.The following Practical Guidance resources will provide more information on powers of attorney in Florida:Go to table5Current as of: 05/20/2025
