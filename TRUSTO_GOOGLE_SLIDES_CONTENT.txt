SLIDE 1: TITLE
=====================================

🔒 TRUSTO
The Plaid for Trusts

Making $50 Trillion in Trust Assets
as Liquid as a Checking Account

Trusto.inc | Series A Pitch | 2024

=====================================
SLIDE 2: PROBLEM
=====================================

Every Investor in This Room Has Experienced This

👨‍💼 TRUST OWNER:
"I need to add my trust to my mortgage refinance. The bank wants a 'certification of trust' but rejected my actual trust document. Now I need my lawyer, it'll take 3 weeks, and cost $2,000."

🏦 BANK MANAGER:
"Another trust certification request. Our legal team won't review the full trust, so I'll send our custom form. The client will make errors, it'll bounce back twice, and we'll lose the deal."

THE HIDDEN COSTS:
• Trust Owners: $500-2,000 per certification, 2-4 week delays
• Banks: $50-100M annually (JPMorgan alone)
• Economy: Billions in transaction friction

=====================================
SLIDE 3: MARKET OPPORTUNITY
=====================================

The Trust Economy is Massive and Growing

10% of Americans own trusts
They control 60% of American wealth ($50+ Trillion)

MICRO EXAMPLE (Personal Scale):
• Average trust owner: 5 financial accounts
• Annual certification needs: 2-3 per trust owner
• Current cost per certification: $500-2,000
• Time lost: 2-4 weeks each

MACRO SCALE (Market Size):
• 32M+ trust owners × 2.5 certifications/year = 80M annual certifications
• $500 average cost = $40B annual market
• Just processing costs = $8B+ annual inefficiency

This market is invisible because it's so fragmented and painful

=====================================
SLIDE 7: FLYWHEEL
=====================================

The Flywheel - Network Effects

More Trust Owners → More Valuable to Banks → More Banks Join Platform
       ↑                                                    ↓
Better User Experience ← More Data & Learning ← Higher Volume Processing

WHY THIS CREATES DEFENSIBLE MOATS:

DATA NETWORK EFFECTS:
• More trust processing = better AI accuracy
• More bank integrations = universal acceptance
• More legal precedents = faster resolution

SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMIES OF SCALE:
• Fixed cost of legal infrastructure spreads across users
• Technology development costs amortize with volume
• Regulatory compliance becomes competitive advantage

This becomes winner-take-most in trust infrastructure
